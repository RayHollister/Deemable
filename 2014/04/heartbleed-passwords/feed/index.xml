		<description><![CDATA[That comparison of locks and keys with the heartbleed bug is so apt! Very informative article. Although, My fav tool is Password Depot. I think it is the best password manager out there. Password Depot not just comes in handy in times like such security threats, but also is very useful in day to day life. Creates and manages new passwords. Not just that, it manages other data like credit card, debit card and other important data. I think one should use password managers not just for security reasons but also for comfort. http://www.password-depot.com/]]></description>
