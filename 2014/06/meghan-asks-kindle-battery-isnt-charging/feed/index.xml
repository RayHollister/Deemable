		<description><![CDATA[I now have the same issue as the OP. Thank goodness I kept reading and didn&#039;t just throw my hands up in the air and go off what the &quot;expert&quot; Tom said. After working with the plug a bit (playing to see what it wanted), it&#039;s now charging. 

Goes to show you... you get what you pay for... in this case, so-called free expert advice. Thanks to the rest of the posters for coming through!! But I&#039;m also favoriting the youtube video I found that gave some invaluable advice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This information is not correct. If it is your battery, they are replaceable. Buy one on eBay. If you have the tools to open the kindle, you can change the battery. I&#039;m not a computer tech and watched how-to videos and did it on my own. I replaced my whole lcd/digitizer. As for the connection, if you know someone who can solder and the charging piece came detached from the board, that can be fixed too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My mother is now on her 3rd Kindle Fire.  The first one, lasted two years and quit charging.  I replaced the battery, disassembled and inspected the charging port, it is secure and undamaged.  There is no physical damage at all. She bought a Kindle Fire HDX in April &#039;14.  It quit charging in Sept.  It was replaced under warranty but when this one dies, I&#039;m advising her to get an Apple.  Yeah, they cost more, but I know many people who have them, (myself included) and almost zero problems from all of them.  I am NOT an Apple zombie, but there stuff lasts.  I&#039;m typing this on a 2008 Macbook Pro.  I have replaced the battery but nothing else.  Not even a hiccup. Jus&#039; sayin&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Meghan, try putting your charger only half way on (don&#039;t insert it all the way).  Mine was doing the same thing and I was so mad until I tried this - it is a known defect so if it works call Amazon customer service, tell them about the &#039;half way&#039; fix and they will give you a really good deal on an upgrade or replace it.  Even if it is out of warranty, like mine was. :)]]></description>
