		<description><![CDATA[I have been taken for a ride!  I read Eva&#039;s story but my ending is different.  I bought into the story and spent the 350 to boot.  Now because of their return to me (and I believed them) I am sitting with two gift cards totaling $200 that was to purchase a piece of equipment so I wouldn&#039;t be hacked again.  :They&quot; didn&#039;t follow through so I am out of luck and don&#039;t know where I stand in security.  What should I do now.  I have a &quot;case number, a copy of what looks like a support report, and two cards I can&#039;t use - for iTunes.  What can I do now?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How do you get them to stop calling? I was ALMOST taken in by this scam. Only saw a second charge that raised eyebrows that alerted me. I got all my money back. They call me AND my parents phone # (they probably correlated the two from the phone book- same last name and address). I don&#039;t know how to get them to stop.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[2016 and getting hp scammers.  The first time I was having trouble connecting my new printer to my computer because of Windows 10 (horrible!), they wanted to download a program and it would only cost me $$.  This time I just tried to question them about mirror imaging (which doesn&#039;t seem to be on my $300 printer!).  They asked me a couple of questionable questions (this was via hp.com), I stated my issue at the beginning and it was obvious he hadn&#039;t read it.  Nothing new these days. But when he told me it was a technical issue I new he was a phony.  I tried to call hp to make them aware.  Again a scammer!  They just kept asking me what device I was calling about (phone, printer, laptop, etc) and wouldn&#039;t address the issue of the scammer and who I needed to talk to about the problem.]]></description>
