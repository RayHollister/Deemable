		<description><![CDATA[I was unaware of the limited number of times that a flash drive can be written to and am wondering if this applies to mass flash storage units such as in my MacBook Pro, which uses flash memory instead of a hard drive. Also, I&#039;m not sure how secure delete, which normally overwrites a sector many times, works with Flash Memory. Will these multiple overwrites affect the life of the drive?

Thanks,]]></description>
