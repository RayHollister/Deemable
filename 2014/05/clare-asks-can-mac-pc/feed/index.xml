		<description><![CDATA[Clare: I run Windows 8.1 and Mac OS X 10.9 on my Macbook Pro. (That&#039;s actually my laptop in the picture!) It&#039;s the best Windows laptop I have ever used, and I have lost count of how many I have used. You have no more vulnerability of getting a virus on Windows as you do on any other Windows laptop, and installing Windows on Bootcamp does NOT create a virus vulnerability for your Mac OS partition. A KVM switch will not change the fact that you would have to buy two separate computers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clare: I do not recommend to install Windows on a Mac. Besides the interface it is awful you will create a virus vulnerability for your computer. 
Try a KVM switch, that means a hardware device that allows you to control multiple computers from one keyboard, video monitor and mouse. It is possible to control a Mac and a PC together and you can get it for $30 up. 
Note: to connect the Mac to de KVM you will need a Mac or Mac compatible connector.
