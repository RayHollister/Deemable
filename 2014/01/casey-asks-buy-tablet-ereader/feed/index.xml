		<description><![CDATA[About readers versus tablets, I would shout hurray for tablets.  I have a rebuilt HP tablet.  I have apps for books, e-books, audio books, magazines, movies, newspapers, TV news, radio shows, and all of what the internet has to offer.  I am going blind and love the tablet beause I can see everything.  It does have some issues due to the OS used in the rebuild, but as you have pointed out, the reading is/swell, and so are all the other goodies.  

Now, if you can decipher &quot;Cyanogen&quot; OS for me, I would love my tablet without reservation.  We got a good deal on it, only $100.  I&#039;m almost 83 and do not have the clever mind anymore to dig for everything that is on here that I am missing.  

Love all your programs that I hear on NPR.]]></description>
