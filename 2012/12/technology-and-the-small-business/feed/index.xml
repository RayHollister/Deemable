		<description><![CDATA[Awesome! This lady really makes some great products with love in each package. As a loyal customer of Nicole Made This products, I implore everyone to sample her stuff. I especially love her baby shampoo for my daughter and anything she makes in the Bellini&#039;s with Brunch , Lemon Grass or even the Fruit Loops scent! My daughter thoroughly enjoys her Bliss Bubble Bits where just a little makes a ton of bubbles for her baths. Nicole is incredibly professional and really knows her stuff! I highly recommend coming to sample goods at the next Art Walk or browse her website www.NicoleMadeThis.com !!!]]></description>
