		<description><![CDATA[RE: Passwords - I read a great article over at Lifehacker on how to create unique passwords that are easy to remember.  The short and sweet is to have a base password that uses a combination of letters (upper and lower case) number and special characters that are meaningful to you, and then use something like the first several characters of the site you are logging into as the unique part.  So, for instance, your base password could be your spouse&#039;s initials (I&#039;ll use &quot;ABC&quot; for the example&quot;), plus the date of birth of your first child (I&#039;ll use 0101 for the example).  Then, the first three letters of the site.  So, if I was going to log into Deemable Tech, my password could look like ABC0101dee.  Then, you just use the ABC0101 for all your passwords, and just switch out the last part per web site.

Here&#039;s the article I referenced: http://lifehacker.com/184773/geek-to-live--choose-and-remember-great-passwords]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another great use for Where&#039;s My Droid is getting someone&#039;s attention.  For instance, my wife tends to set her phone to silent, and then forget to restore her ringer (A great app to deal with that automatically is Shush! Ringer Restorer).  So, if I&#039;m trying to get in contact with her, but she&#039;s blissfully unaware that her phone is ringing, I can use Where&#039;s My Droid to force her ringer to go full-volume for several minutes, which gets her attention.
Saved our marriage.
