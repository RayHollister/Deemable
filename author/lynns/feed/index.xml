<html><body><p><a href="/media/2013/07/BreakfastWithSundarPichai.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7541" title="Please join us for breakfast with Sundar Pichai. No, not us, Google." alt="Please join us for breakfast with Sundar Pichai" src="/media/2013/07/BreakfastWithSundarPichai-291x300.png"  width="291" height="300"></a>The most recent trending on tech news today is centered&nbsp;on the invitation sent by Google to different companies, manufacturers, and media organizations regarding an Android event scheduled on July 24th in San Francisco. Despite the urgency of the invites, it is still unclear to everyone what is special about it that Google took the lead.</p>
<p>What could an important event be that required the attendance&nbsp;of Google&rsquo;s Senior Vice President for Android Sundar&nbsp;Pichai? Google might be cooking up something major and worth everyone&rsquo;s attention. Take note that there was a huge leap in Google&rsquo;s latest update for Android and Nexus products that was released in May. Whatever is in the works for next week&rsquo;s event is something to look forward to because it just might be worth the wait.</p>
<p>Many people have assumed that the main goal of Google for setting up such a momentous gathering is the possibility of&nbsp;launching the newest version of Android OS which is Android 4.3 and the introduction of the most recent Nexus product the Nexus 7.2.</p>
<p>These two products will surely take the gadget world through hype because hungry users have been waiting&nbsp;for them to come out in the market. The newest Android version 4.3 is similar to 4.2 in some aspects. It has been said&nbsp;that the 4.2.2 version of the operating system was skipped&nbsp;for some reason. The 4.3 release is expected&nbsp;with a big bang and should not be missed.</p>
<p>Android 4.3 is the upgraded version of the 4.2. Some new features include Bluetooth Light Energy or LE, font changes and personalization, and some easy tweaks to the gadget&rsquo;s camera application.</p>
<p>In contrast to Android&rsquo;s OS upgraded version 4.3, sources say that Nexus 7.2 is a total upgrade from the old Nexus 7. Some of the major changes you might see in the Nexus 7.2 tab that may be available later this month are 1980&times;1200 displays, 5 megapixel cameras, and the Snapdragon 600 quad-core processor. All of these features are very significant to techy nerds out there.</p>
<p>It is said that the ASUS-built Nexus 7.2 series of tablets will really hit it big after the launch, and have been the object of discussion in blogs and write-ups.</p>
<p>These two new products offered by Google, Android 4.3 and ASUS-built Nexus 7.2 will surely be a fantastic hit and might mean higher price tags on initial launch.</p>
<p>Google did not give out a word about the purpose of the event on the 24th but people have strong ideas as to&nbsp;what it is all about. The internet giant never confirmed or denied the news about the product release. Better leave people to speculate, most especially those who belong to social networking sites. We really have no idea whether or not Google will launch two of their latest products. Meantime, hang on to your seats!</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important question is, what will Google be serving for breakfast?</p>

<html><body><p><a href="/media/2013/07/MaAilun.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright wp-image-7530" title="Ma Ailun, young bride-to-be tragically killed by electricution according to the victims family" alt="Ma Ailun" src="/media/2013/07/MaAilun.jpg"  width="384" height="215"></a>Recent reports involving the death of a 23-year old Chinese while using her iPhone got mixed reactions on the Internet. This news created speculations and doubts on the true cause following her death in July 11. Despite the press release by Apple Incorporated to &ldquo;fully investigate&rdquo; the matter, people from all over the world are shaken by the news and the Chinese community is jittery with this tragic incident.</p>
<p>According to the family of the victim, Ma Ailun was bathing when her phone rang. The former flight attendant from China&rsquo;s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region quickly stepped into to her room and picked up the phone to answer the call while it was charging. The family also claimed that the victim was using the original accessories after purchasing the device from an authorized distributor in China way back December.</p>
<p>The Public Safety Bureau in Xinjiang conducted a detailed investigation proving that Ms. Ma&rsquo;s death was due to obvious electronic injury on her neck. However, the claim that her iPhone had something to do with it is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Apple Inc. extended its utmost and deepest condolences to the bereaved family. &ldquo;We are saddened to learn about this tragic incident and offer our condolences to the Ma family. We will fully investigate and cooperate with authorities in this matter,&rdquo; says Apple.</p>
<p>However, Ms. Ma&rsquo;s sister vented out her grief and frustration in the most popular social media in China, Seina Weibo, which is a social network similar to Twitter. &ldquo;I hope that Apple Inc. can give us an explanation and I also hope that all you will refrain from using your mobile devices while charging,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>While it is true that using unauthorized charges and accessories to mobile devices can cause harm to the user, Prof. Will Stewart from the Institute of Engineering and Technology proved that using a mobile device while its charging is completely safe and acceptable. &ldquo;The charger&rsquo;s output is low voltage?about five volts?a weak capability to be considered dangerous,&rdquo; according to the doctor.</p>
<p>In addition, he reiterated that something in the actual charger could be at fault for the electrocution. It could also be the main plug. He said that &ldquo;owners of mobile devices should try to avoid using mains-connected equipment while in the bath. If they are extremely wet, the water could run down the wire and into the plug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether these allegations are true or not but it is very essential to stay safe while using your mobile devices. It is imperative to buy gadgets through authorized distributors and use only authentic accessories to keep you out from harm&rsquo;s way.</p>
