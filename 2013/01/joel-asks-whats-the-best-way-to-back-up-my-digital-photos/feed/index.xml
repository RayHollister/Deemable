		<description><![CDATA[Good question, Hamim. By redundancy I mean you want to have your files backed up in multiple places. CrashPlan+ and Pogoplug both have services that will backup your files on an external harddrive and online. 

Unfortunately, I don&#039;t know of any system that will backup your files in more than two places. Most of your files don&#039;t need to be backed up more than twice, but we do recommend that really important files be backed up in three places. For those files, I would try those gold plated DVD-Rs, and/or regular DVD-Rs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are gold plated DVD-Rs that claim to last 50-100 years, but I won&#039;t believe it until I see it. 

The best way to back up your digital photos is with redundancy. Have an external backup drive for emergencies. Have an online backup for the real emergencies, and then sure, try a gold plated DVD-R.]]></description>
