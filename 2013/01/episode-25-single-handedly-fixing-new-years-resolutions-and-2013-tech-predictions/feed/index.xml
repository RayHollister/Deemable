		<description><![CDATA[Also: If you&#039;re trying to make or break a habit, Habit Streak is a good app. I have the &quot;Pro&quot; version on my (Android) phone, and basically it asks you every morning &quot;Did you do [insert habit here] yesterday?&quot; and you tell it yes or no. It keeps track of how many days in a row you&#039;ve kept up the habit, and shows you that number so that you want to not break your winning streak. There are a bunch of apps that do this in various ways, but this is my favorite.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My Fitness Pal! I&#039;m on there as Jess0 if you want to be friends. It&#039;s really handy, and I love the &quot;If every day were like today&quot; thingy that is shows you at the end of the day. 

I also set up a reminder in Tasker so that it makes a notification pop up around each meal time to remind me to log my food. The notification pops up, I open my notification area thingy and tap it, and it takes me to the app. I&#039;m very forgetful, so Tasker is my friend.]]></description>
