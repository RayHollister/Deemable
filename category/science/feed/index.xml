<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>
<p>RAY: From WJCT studios in Jacksonville, Florida, I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister,</p>
<p>TOM: I&rsquo;m Tom Braun,</p>
<p>RAY: and this is Deemable Tech. The Deemable Tech Podcast is brought to you by A Small Orange, Homegrown Hosting. A refreshingly different approach to web hosting. On the web at a small orange dot com.</p>
<p>TOM: Got a question about your computer, smart phone, tablet or the Internet? You can give us a call us at One Eight Eight Eight, Nine Seven Two, Nine Eight Six Eight, or send us an email to questions@deemable.com.</p>
<p>TOM: Well we?re back after quite a long break. Let?s address the elephant in the room. Ray, what happened?</p>
<p>RAY: Well, I had major surgery!</p>
<p>TOM: Today on the show we?re changing things up a little.</p>
<p>RAY: Right, we are going to be doing fewer questions. We?ve realized that the people who listen to our podcast and the people that listen to our radio segments on NPR are not necessarily the same people.</p>
<p>TOM: With all due respect to any radio listeners out there, the typical podcast listener is a little more tech savvy. And we want to make this podcast more interesting for you guys. We don?t have a specific plan. Instead we?re going to try different things. And if you have suggestions for things you?d like to hear us try, let us know. Questions@deemable.com.</p>
<p>RAY: Well, later on in the show, we have some cool tech products to review, but before we jump into that, what do we have on the docket first, Tom.</p>
<p>TOM: We?ve come up with a segment called DOES NOT COMPUTE. I?ve compiled some quiz-show style questions about tech facts, things that the average user may not know. I?m going to ask Ray joined by our producer Sean Birch some of these questions and we?ll see how they do.</p>
<p>Where did the word robot originate from?</p>
<p>Ken Olsen, the founder of DEC, said in 1977, ?There?s no reason for any individual to have a ____ in their home.?</p>
<p>What is the only sport played on the moon?</p>
<p>In a vacuum light travels at 670 and a half million MPH. Harvard scientists recently used slowed a beam of light down to what speed?</p>
<p>How many bytes are there in a kilobyte?</p>
<p><strong>Reviews</strong></p>
<p><a href="//2013/08/therapik-bug-bite-itch-relief-gadget-review/">Therapik Bug Bite Itch Relief Gadget</a></p>
<p><a href="//2013/07/bluetooth-stereo-headset-review-jabra-halo2/">Jabra HALO2 Bluetooth Headhpones</a></p>

<p>Our producer is Sean Birch. I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister, I&rsquo;m Tom Braun, and this is Deemable Tech. Thanks for listening. Have a great week.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>It&rsquo;s been a couple of weeks since we did a <a title="Deemable Tech's Friday Funnies" href="//category/friday-funnies/" target="_blank">Friday Funnies article&nbsp;here on Deemable Tech</a>. This week&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t hilarious, as much as it is just plain fun. Have you ever wondered how astronauts wash their hands in space? Me neither! I&rsquo;ve wondered about how astronauts do almost every other bodily function in space, but it never crossed my mind to think about cleaning up. I&rsquo;m not sure what that says about me. Regardless, here&rsquo;s Canadian&nbsp;Astronaut Chris Hadfield on the International Space Station demonstrating how they do it.</p>

He's Said that Before" href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2072748,00.html" target="_blank">May 21, 2011</a>. Nor are we talking about <a title="Harold Camping Calls May 21 An 'Invisible Judgment Day,' Says October 21 Is Real End-Of-World Date " href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/23/harold-camping-says-october-21-real-end-of-world_n_865978.html" target="_blank">the end of the world that was supposed to come on October 21, 2011</a>. We&rsquo;re not even talking about the one that was supposed to happen in <a title="Camping Misses End of World" href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1994/october24/4tc084.html" target="_blank">September of 1994</a>. This is the <em>Mayan</em>&nbsp;Apocalypse. The one that everyone decided is going to happen because the Mayans ran out of room on their calendar, and the last date they were able to put on it was December 21, 2012. It&rsquo;s the equivalent of the <a title="Y2K bug fails to bite | BBC NEWS" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/585013.stm" target="_blank">Y2K bug</a> of the 5th century.</p>
<p>If you believe that tomorrow is going to be&nbsp;the end of the world, and you haven&rsquo;t made plans yet, you, dear reader,&nbsp;are the textbook definition of a procrastinator. In fact, if we have dictionaries after the apocalypse, your picture will be next to the word. (We&rsquo;ll get your picture from you after it&rsquo;s over.) That being said, if you still have time, there are some great options to ride it out. Here are two of our favorites. Check out the link to the New York Daily News at the bottom the full photo gallery slide show, and click the photos below for a larger view.</p>
<h4><a title="Atlas Survival Shelters-Underground Shelters-Bomb Shelters" href="http://www.atlassurvivalshelters.com/">Atlas Survival Shelters</a></h4>
<p>These bomb shelters are made&nbsp;from 10 foot diameter galvanized corrugated pipe. They come in 25 foot long and 50 foot long models. They&rsquo;ve been featured on National Geographic&rsquo;s Doomsday Preppers, and they even have a survival camp for customers to learn how to survive an apocalypse. That would have been good information to&nbsp;know,&nbsp;if you had prepared ahead. Since you didn&rsquo;t, and you waited until the last minute, you&rsquo;ll just have to wing it.</p>

<h4><a title="Luxury Survival Condo" href="http://www.survivalcondo.com/" target="_blank">Luxury Survival Condos</a></h4>
<p>If you have between $1.5 and 3 million sitting around, why not spend it on making your life a little more comfortable for the next few years? What else are you gonna spend it on? A Maserati? If the apocalypse does come, you won&rsquo;t have anywhere to drive it! Built deep in the heart of one of two nuclear missile silos in the heartland of America with spacious floor plans, jacuzzi bath tubs, big screen LED TVs&nbsp;in every room, and lethal and non-lethal defenses, you won&rsquo;t even notice that the world is crumbling all around you while you sleep, relax and live in the lap of luxury.&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re not enjoying your generous personal living space, you can join the community at the movie theater, game arcade, and lounge.&nbsp;And if&nbsp;you&rsquo;re starting to feel a bit of cabin fever, you can relax in the indoor pool and spa, stretch your muscles in the exercise facility and on rock climbing wall, or try out your green thumb&nbsp;in hydroponic food farm. Luxury Survival Condo will even take care of your transportation to the condo in the event of an emergency! So, the question isn&rsquo;t why would you buy a Luxury Survival Condo, but why wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>

<h4>TRANSCRIPT:</h4>
<p>RAY HOLLISTER: In the movies, cell phones never seem to get wet unless it helps to move the plot along, like when Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s character, Andy Sachs, in &ldquo;The Devil Wears Prada&rdquo; tosses her ringing cell phone in the fountain after she decides that she doesn&rsquo;t want to be like her work obsessed boss, Miranda Priestly, or like when Tim Allen&rsquo;s character in &ldquo;Wild Hogs&rdquo; throws John Travolta&rsquo;s cell phone into the fountain.</p>
<p><span id="more-4541"></span></p>
<p>Scene from &ldquo;Wild Hogs&rdquo;<br>
WOODY (John Travolta): You don&rsquo;t need a GPS to discover America! You need a bike, and you need the road. OK? Freedom! And if we have an emergency, I got a cell phone.<br>
DOUG (Tim Allen): No, you don&rsquo;t! (Tosses Woody&rsquo;s cell phone into the fountain)<br>
WOODY: What! Hey! Why&rsquo;d you do that? I&rsquo;ve got all my data in there!<br>
DOUG: Well! How does that feel, Woody?<br>
WOODY: (Pauses) It feels good! Wooo! (Sings) It&rsquo;s my prerogative! No cell phones!<br>
DOUG: Wait a minute. No wait. Come on!<br>
BOBBY (Martin Lawrence): Doug, Doug, Doug. He&rsquo;s right. Wooo! Yeah! Yeah, Wild Hogs Baby! Wild Hogs!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in real life, some cell phones end up in the water even when we don&rsquo;t want them to. For example, when your dog walks up to see what you are doing with your cell phone next to the pool,</p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Whatcha doing mate? Hey, whatcha doin&rsquo;?</p>
<p>SOUND OF MAN AND CAMERA FALLING INTO THE POOL<br><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="752" height="453" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Il6HvPWL9jQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>RAY HOLLISTER: or when you&rsquo;re showing off how good the video camera works on your new iPhone&hellip;next to the pool.</p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: OK, so I&rsquo;m taking video with my new iPhone 3G camera. OK, this is great! This, this is perfect, lovely. And uh, yeah, this is&hellip;</p>
<p>SOUND OF MAN SLIPPING AND FALLING INTO THE POOL<br><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="752" height="453" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_qbWjaW25mQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh crap. (indiscernible background voices) Wait, it&rsquo;s still works!</p>
<p>RAY HOLLISTER: That guy was lucky, but unfortunately whether it&rsquo;s at the pool, the ocean, the tub, the dogs water bowl, or even the toilet, mobile phones have a way of slipping out of our hands and ending up soaked, and that usually means that they are completely destroyed.</p>
<p>But, what if it didn&rsquo;t have to be that way? Now, there are several products on the market that will waterproof your phone, from expensive military grade cases to something as simple as a Ziploc&reg; baggie, and there are several how to videos on the internet showing you how to fix your phone if it does gets soaked, from tricks involving blow dryers, freezers, and even rice to get the water out of your phone and possibly save it.</p>
<p>But, what if you could just dunk your phone in water all you wanted to and it would never break? You&rsquo;d never have to worry about sweat getting on it when you went running, a spilled drink at a cocktail party, or a toddler&rsquo;s juice box getting sprayed all over your phone.</p>
<p>This dream might soon become a reality. This year at the 2012 Consumer Electronics Show a company called Zagg, introduced a new technology they&rsquo;re calling HzO WaterBlock. They demonstrated the technology by dunking an iPod touch, a Samsung Galaxy S and several other devices in a glass of water and in a fish tank! The Samsung Galaxy S performed as if nothing was wrong, and the iPod touch continued playing music the entire time it was in the water. They even dunked the external speaker they had attached to it in the fish tank, and it too continued working.</p>
<p>They apply the HzO Waterblock by placing the device in a vacuum and then filling that vacuum with a vapor. This vapor then fills every crack and crevice inside your device applying a nano-scale film barrier that once dried protects the electronics from water and humidity. Of course, the chemical that the vapor is comprised of is proprietary and the entire process is patented. So, they won&rsquo;t tell us much about it, but they say that the chemical is non-toxic, organic material.</p>
<p>So, what I wanted to know is when can I get my iPhone 4S Waterblocked? Well, HzO doesn&rsquo;t make phones, and there not trying to get in the business of aftermarket alterations. They are going to be doing a special limited release of WaterBlocked iPod touches, iPod Nanos, and iPod Shuffles with HzO inside. However, ZAGG is primarily interested in licsensing the technology to device manufacturers. So, hopefully, companies like Apple and Samsung will adopt this technology, and we&rsquo;ll see it in the next generation of devices, perhaps at CES 2013.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, you&rsquo;ll just have to being careful when you&rsquo;re using your cell phone&hellip;next to the pool&hellip;or other water.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting in Lyon, France, Member&rsquo;s of the World Health Organization formed a panel in late May to discuss the potential carcinogenic hazards from exposure to  radiofrequency electromagnetic fields, like those emitted by cellular  phones and other wireless communications devices. The panel, which represents the <a title="IARC" href="http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf" target="_blank">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a> (IARC), consisted of 31 scientists from 14 different countries. While the group did not conduct any new research, the panel reviewed    numerous existing studies that focused on the health effects of the   radiofrequency  magnetic fields emitted from cellphones, and concluded that there is a <em>possibility</em> that exposure to these low levels of radiation  might induce long-term health risks, including an increased risk of cancer.</p>
<p>The IARC panel classified cellphones under the category<em> Group 2B, </em>the same category as   certain dry cleaning chemicals, pesticides such as DDT, engine    exhaust, lead, and various  other industrial chemicals. However, the cellphone  industry was quick to point out that pickled vegetables and coffee also  made the <em>2B</em> designation, which is <a title="IARC" href="http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf" target="_blank">defined by the IARC</a> below:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This category is used for agents for which there is limited evidence  of  carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of   carcinogenicity in experimental animals. It may also be used when there   is inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans but there is   sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. In some   instances, an agent for which there is inadequate evidence of   carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of   carcinogenicity in experimental animals together with supporting   evidence from mechanistic and other relevant data may be placed in this   group. An agent may be classified in this category solely on the basis   of strong evidence from mechanistic and other relevant data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major medical groups such as  the American Cancer Society and   the National Cancer Institute have reassured the public that there is little concern in regards to adverse health effects because cellphones emit nonionizing radiation &ndash; which are supposedly non-cancerous. In February, however, researchers from the National Institutes of Health published a study which found that less than an hour of cellphone usage can speed up brain activity at the area nearest to the phone antenna. This study was one of the most significant of its kind to document the measurable effects of the radio frequency signals to the brain.</p>
<p><a title="Brain Activity" href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/cellphone-use-tied-to-changes-in-brain-activity/" target="_blank">The New York Times reported</a>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the past, any concerns about the  health effects of cellphones have  been largely dismissed because the  radiofrequency waves emitted from  the devices are believed to be  benign. Cellphones emit nonionizing  radiation, waves of energy that are  too weak to break chemical bonds or  to set off the DNA damage known to  cause cancers. Scientists have said  repeatedly that there is no known  biological mechanism to explain how  nonionizing radiation might lead to  cancer or other health problems.</p>
<p>But the new study opens up an  entirely new potential area of  research. Although an increase in brain  glucose metabolism happens  during normal brain function, the question  is whether repeated  artificial stimulation as a result of exposure to  electromagnetic  radiation might have a detrimental effect.</p>
<p>Although speculative, one theory  about how an artificial increase in brain glucose metabolism could be  harmful is that it could potentially lead to the creation of molecules  called free radicals, which in excess can damage healthy cells. Or it  may be that repeated stimulation by electromagnetic radiation could set  off an inflammatory response, which studies suggest is associated with a  number of health problems, including cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While there are no official recommendations for the public following the   study, the use of hands-free devices and text messaging may lower   exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic waves emitted by cellphones. Even though all of this may seem alarming, the <em>Group 2B</em> designation simply means that there may (or may not) be a <em>possible</em> link between cellphone usage and certain forms of cancer. In other words, this is fearmongering at its finest, and <a title="Colbert" href="http://gizmodo.com/5807815/stephen-colbert-solves-this-whole-cellphone-radiation-problem" target="_blank">Stephen Colbert has already solved the problem</a>.</p>

That is what someone usually asks before they give you bad news. This time the bad news is that sitting down itself might be killing you. According to research by the <a title="The Most Dangerous Thing You'll Do All Day - Men's Health on Yahoo!" href="http://health.yahoo.net/experts/menshealth/most-dangerous-thing-youll-do-all-day" target="_blank">Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana</a>, if you sit for most of the day you are <strong>54%</strong> more likely to die from a heart attack, and according to research gathered by <a title="Just How Dangerous Is Sitting All Day? [INFOGRAPHIC] - Mashable" href="http://mashable.com/2011/05/09/sitting-down-infographic/" target="_blank">Medical Billing and Coding</a>, you are <strong>40%</strong> more likely to die within 15 years if you sit more than 6 hours per day than someone who sits less than 3 hours a day. That percentage does not change, even if you regularly exercise!</p>
<p><strong>Why? </strong>Scientists are not completely sure. What they do know is that the enzymes that help break up fat drop by <strong>90%</strong>&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;the calories that your body is burning drops to 1 per minute immediately after you sit down. To make things worse, the good cholesterol level in your body drops by 20% after you have been sitting for 2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Now what? </strong>Most American professional jobs involve long hours of sitting. So, what are we supposed to do, quit our jobs and go become lumberjacks? Fortunately, that is not the only answer. A popular solution that has been discussed about in the media a lot lately has been to use <a title="Are You Sitting Down? Why a Stand-Up Desk Might Save Your Life [PICS] - Mashable.com" href="http://mashable.com/2011/04/22/standup-desks/" target="_blank">a stand up desk</a>. As the name implies, a stand up desk allows you to work at your computer without a chair. You can stand, wiggle, walk in place or even do jumping jacks while you work. As strange as it might sound, many famous people worked at standing desks including Thomas Jefferson, <a title="Ernest Hemingway at his standing writing desk - LIFE magazine" href="http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?q=Ernest+Hemingway+standing+life&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DErnest%2BHemingway%2Bstanding%2Blife%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DN%26tbm%3Disch&amp;imgurl=11d3590e591b8b79">Ernest Hemmingway</a>, <a title="To Sit, to Stand, to Write - Cabinet Magazine" href="http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/32/pendle.php">Virginia Woolf</a>, Leonardo da Vinci, and even <a title="Donald Rumsfeld on 'Piers Morgan Tonight' - AOL Video" href="http://video.aol.com/video/donald-rumsfeld-on-piers-morgan-tonight-030811-tv-replay/559195875">Donald Rumsfeld</a>.</p>
<p>Stand up desks can cost anywhere from $150 to $2,000! However, there are plenty of tutorials online to help you convert your existing desk to a stand up desk or build one from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>But my feet hurt&hellip; </strong>There are many&nbsp;reasons why you might not want to or you might not be able to stand at your desk. <a title="Why and How I Switched to a Standing Desk - Smarterware" href="http://smarterware.org/7102/how-and-why-i-switched-to-a-standing-deskhttp:/smarterware.org/7102/how-and-why-i-switched-to-a-standing-desk">You do not have to completely switch immediately</a>. Stand as long as you can until you have to take a break. Then, once you are rested, do it again. A gentler approach is to stand for an hour a day. Then, each day add more time in 15 ? 60 minute increments until you are able to stand all day or as long as you are personally able to.<br>
Here is an awesome web app to help you <a href="http://www.standingclock.com/" target="_blank">keep track of how long you stand each day</a>. Of course, any time that you change your physical activity you should discuss it with your doctor first. Also, if you are committed&nbsp;to it and you do have foot pain, anti-fatigue mats can be purchased at many office supply and discount stores.</p>
<p>If you make the switch to standing, it can be tiring at first. However, those statistics are downright frightening. If standing up could make that large of a difference in our health and life expectancy it might just be worth our effort.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>I recently learned that BP issued a call for proposals to fix the environmental problem that resulted from the devastating oil spill in the Gulf Coast last year. When I came across a Wired.com news item about how games are an example of positive psychology, my interest was piqued and I had a &ldquo;eureka!&rdquo; moment.&nbsp; In Clive Thompson&rsquo;s article&nbsp; entitled <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/02/st_thompson_living_games/">?How Games Make Work Seem Like Play,?</a> Thompson discusses how by applying game design to certain problems, the competitive function of work will help provide a solution by motivating folks, who usually lack the inspiration, to tackle the world&rsquo;s biggest problems.</p>
<p>According to Thompson, an episode within Parliament where British politicians were caught filing millions of pounds&rsquo; worth of personal expenses was dealt with by utilizing this &ldquo;work for play-method.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thompson wrote that in answer to the public&rsquo;s uproar, the government scanned hundreds of thousands of the incriminated receipts and dumped the files online.&nbsp; He also stated that the editors from The Guardian had no choice but to fight back.</p>
<p>According to the Wired.com article, they took what was supposed to be an insurmountable task, and made it possible by creating a web app that would randomly send players a receipt.&nbsp; Thompson reported that if the receipt looked suspicious participants would write a short description of what they found and send it over to the editors of The Guardian</p>
<p>The article stated that a leader board tracked which contributors made the most finds, and in less than four days with 20,000 players analyzing 170,000 pages worth of data.&nbsp; The Guardian&rsquo;s game plan had worked; they now had the evidence they needed to indict the guilty members of Parliament.</p>
<p>If The Guardian could make work fun, why can&rsquo;t BP?&nbsp; Thompson says that Jane McGonigal, a game designer and author of the book, Reality is Broken, has done precisely that.&nbsp; He wrote that she co-designed a role-playing game called World Without Oil, which encourages thousands of players to brainstorm of a way to peak oil.&nbsp; Yet this positive way to get more people involved in solving world problems has not come without some opposition.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are those that call this whole work-for-fun method a classic example of the Tom Sawyer trick, where the character is able to trick others to do the work for him by showing off how much fun he is having while painting a fence.&nbsp; And there are others who think this is just one huge, corporate scam.</p>
<p>What is so different behind this work-for-play premise than a call for proposals to fix a problem?&nbsp; Players are definitely participating because they want to and it&rsquo;s fun, whereas papers and proposals are just plain work.&nbsp; My example would be innovative school projects that would encourage you how to learn while stimulating you on a creative level.&nbsp; Rather than go about learning in a dull, dry way, teachers are trying to find new techniques in order to teach their pupils how to problem-solve without making them fall asleep.&nbsp; In the long run, you get your work done and perhaps the world will be a better place because of it, so what&rsquo;s the problem here?</p>
<p>Following the vein of TV shows popping up on the History, Discovery, and Travel Channel?shows like Museum Secrets and Mysteries at the Museums that are addressing the infamous enigmas behind these major repositories of learning?I wasn&rsquo;t surprised when I came across another article on <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/03/mystery-game-vanished-at-the-smithsonian/">Wired.com</a> previewing a game the folks from MIT and the Smithsonian are unleashing in April.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vanished invites kids and teens 11 to 14 to participate in the role of scientific detectives, although older participants can also follow along with special ?watcher? accounts,&rdquo; said Michael Anderson in his Wired.com article.</p>
<p>Although it would be nowhere near solving the world&rsquo;s ancient mysteries, the game will provide intellectual fodder for kids to develop scientific inquiry that will hopefully further their interest in the sciences.&nbsp; Anderson says that Vanished will have middle-school students interact with scientists from the Smithsonian through video chats, and engage in various activities like peer collaboration, collecting scientific data, and participating in various gaming activities in order to unlock a larger mystery inside the project.</p>
<p>So hey, if kids can suspend reality for a few moments within the day to pretend work is no longer dull, tedious work but play, why can&rsquo;t adults?&nbsp; Is it the fact that we are being slightly manipulated to think work is fun?is this something that should bother us? &nbsp; Or are we too old and mature for this sort of fun?</p></body></html>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><a href="//wp-content/uploads/2011/03/drvngcell.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-856" style="padding: 0 10px 10px 0" src="//wp-content/uploads/2011/03/drvngcell-300x229.jpg"  alt="A woman in the driver's seat of a car looking down at her cell phone" width="251" height="190"></a></p>
<p>At some point while driving you may have become distracted when a passenger was talking, a favorite song was playing or while trying to make sure you did not end up wearing your lunch. Driving distracted is not a new issue. In recent times it has come into greater focus because of the increasing use of hand-held technology and other electronic devices. Because of the number of injuries and fatal crashes in recent times, driving while distracted has become a health hazard.</p>
<p>Lives were changed on December 1, 2010 when a <a title="Pedestrian Injured In Car Accident Speaks Out Distracted Drivers  - News Story - KTVU San Francisco" href="http://www.ktvu.com/news/26992292/detail.html" target="_blank">California mother and her two-year daughter were hit by a distracted driver</a> as they crossed the street just a few blocks from home. Ling Murray has no memory of what happened. Both of her legs were shattered with other serious injuries and her daughter Calli was killed. Walking for the first time in three months, Ling remains in a rehabilitation medical facility. The teen that caused the accident admits to using her cell phone at the time the accident occurred.</p>
<p>In 2009 out of 1,517,000 injury crashes reported, about 20 percent involved distracted driving, according to the <a title="Driving Distracted | Stats and Facts | Driving and Texting" href="http://www.distraction.gov/stats-and-facts/index.html" target="_blank">Official U.S. Government Website for Distracted Driving</a>. This included each type of driving distraction: audible, visual, physical and cognitive. One or a combination of distractions can contribute to a crash depending on the driving behavior.</p>
<p>Audible distractions can occur when focusing on music or talking from a passenger or cell phone. Visual distractions occur when the focus is on something or someone outside the car or when reading. Physical distractions happen when removing a hand from the wheel for eating, tending to children, applying cosmetics, making a call or texting. Cognitive distractions are when your mind is not focused such as when you are emotional or daydreaming</p>
<p>So if these <a title="Distracted While Driving | World of Psychology" href="http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2008/06/20/distracted-while-driving/" target="_blank">types of driving behaviors</a> have existed for so long, why so much hype now? For nearly 10 years there has been a significant increase in cell phone use. It has become common to see an individual with a cell phone attached to his or her ear while in traffic. While there has been considerable focus on teenagers and texting, adults are not exempt from this behavior. A&nbsp;cell phone or PDA is a&nbsp;lifeline for business communications among many professionals, and the increasing use of Smartphones and small PC tablets does not improve the situation.</p>
<p>Distracted driving has also become a legislative issue. <a title="Traffic Safety Facts Research Note | Summary of Statistical Findings | Driver Electronic Device Use in 2009 | September 2010" href="http://www.distraction.gov/research/PDF-Files/Driver-Electronic-Device-Use-2009.pdf" target="_blank">In 2010, nearly 30 states established primary and secondary laws on texting and use hand-held devices</a>. With the objective to end distracted driving, goals also include increasing public awareness, expand law enforcement initiatives to reduce injuries and save lives.</p>
<p>Will banning cell phones while driving solve the problem? Should other distracted driving behaviors receive the same legislative treatment as cell phones and other hand-held devices? Why should teenagers be held just as accountable as adults?or should they?&nbsp; Share your views.</p></body></html>

<p>If you are a shutterbug, make sure to grab your camera (and your tripod) and get a few shots while the getting is good. The picture above was the best I could manage with my&nbsp;measly Canon Powershot SX110IS with no tripod. If you get a great shot, be sure to share it in the comments below. &nbsp;Especially if you are on the west coast and you read this <a title="Why does the Moon look so huge on the horizon?" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/05/13/why-does-the-moon-look-so-huge-on-the-horizon/">before the moon rises over the horizon</a>. If you can&rsquo;t tell a Polaroid SX-70 from a Canon EOS 1D Mark IV, but&nbsp;you are out with your significant someone tonight, it would not hurt to pull the car over and stop to stare. <a title="Romantic Date Ideas: Watch the Moonrise" href="http://www.hotdateideas.com/date-ideas/watch-the-moonrise" target="_blank">Your Juliet may find it quite amorous</a>, but of course, don&rsquo;t make <a title="YouTube - romeo and juliet balcony scene" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLWPg3SCYH4#t=5m40s" target="_blank">Romeo&rsquo;s mistake and swear your love by it</a>.</p></body></html>
