<h3><b>Macbook</b></h3>
<p>Apple announced a new laptop, called&hellip;the MacBook.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thinner than the MacBook Air, but it is also less powerful than the MacBook Air and has less battery life than the MacBook Air, and it&rsquo;s more expensive than the MacBook Air. So, it&rsquo;s basically, just like the MacBook Air was to the original MacBook when the MacBook Air came out.</p>
<p>It has a 480p FaceTime Camera, but it does have a retina display though, which gives it an advantage over the MacBook Air.</p>
<p>The craziest part is that, except for the headphone jack, the new MacBook only has one port, USB-C. Everything goes through the USB-C port &ndash; power, display, thumb drives, accessories, everything. To do almost anything you will have to buy an adapter, which costs $79 a piece.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.djtechtools.com/2015/03/09/why-you-wont-be-djing-with-the-new-macbook/">As a result a lot of people will not be buying this laptop, especially DJs</a>.</p>
<p>The new MacBook is available in silver, Space Grey and&hellip; gold, for some reason.</p>
<p>The new MacBook&nbsp;has a new trackpad called a &ldquo;Force Touch&rdquo; trackpad. It does not have a physical button, but it is pressure sensitive, and gives haptic feedback when you click it. The Force Touch trackpad opens up new ways to interact with the computer such as&nbsp;&ldquo;Gradually add pressure to the trackpad to vary the speed with which you fast-forward through a QuickTime movie or zoom in on a location in Maps.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Apple TV &ndash; HBO Now</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/hbo-now/" target="_blank">Apple also announced a partnership with HBO to bring unbundled HBO to cable-cutters</a>. For $14.99 a month you can watch Game of Thrones without a cable subscription, but only on an iOS device.&nbsp;HBO Now is available on iPhone, iPad and the Apple TV.</p>
<h3>ResearchKit</h3>
<p>In one of the most surprising announcements, <a href="http://www.apple.com/researchkit/" target="_blank">Apple revealed ResearchKit</a>. ResearchKit is an open source software development kit that medical researchers can use to easily create apps for studies. The idea is that these apps will utilize the sensors in iPhones to &ldquo;track movement, take measurements and record information &ndash; functions that are perfect for medical studies.&rdquo; iPhone owners would be able to download these apps to participate in research and provide information regardless of where they are. Since iPhones are the most widely used smartphones, it is hoped that this will lead to larger sample sizes and more frequent data, thus creating a truer representation of the population.</p>
<h3>Apple Watch</h3>
<p>Preorders started on the 10th.</p>
<p>The watch will go on sale for reals on April 24th.</p>
<p>Three Versions</p>
<p>There are a whole bunch of combinations of watch bands and cases. Way too many to describe them all. If I did, I am pretty sure Tom would kill me.</p>

<html><body><p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2012/09/YUNOLaunchDate.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-5442 alignleft" title="MOTOROLA AND NOKIA Y U NO GIVE US LAUNCH DATE AND PRICES?" src="//media/2012/09/YUNOLaunchDate-300x225.jpg"  alt="" width="300" height="225"></a>Yesterday, both Nokia and Motorola announced their latest flagship phones, the <a title="Nokia unveils flagship Windows 8 smartphone Lumia 920 | Deemable Tech" href="http://deemable.com/2012/09/nokia-unveils-flagship-windows-8-smartphone/" target="_blank">Lumia 920</a> and the&nbsp;<a title="Motorola and Verizon announce the Droid RAZR HD | Android Central" href="http://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-and-verizon-announce-droid-razr-hd" target="_blank">Droid RAZR HD</a>&nbsp;respectively. Both of them seem like they will be quite impressive phones when they come out. The question that wasn&rsquo;t answered at either of these press conferences is, when are they being released?</p>
<p><a title="Kobo announces 7-inch Android tablet and two new e-readers ahead of Amazon's Kindle event" href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/6/3296243/kobo-arc-glo-mini-tablet-e-reader-announcement" target="_blank">Kobo did the same thing</a> today. They beat Amazon to the punch by announcing two new e-readers and a new 7-inch Android tablet hours before <a title="Live from Amazon's Kindle event at 1:30PM EDT / 6:30PM BST | The Verge" href="http://live.theverge.com/amazon-kindle-fire-paperwhite-reader-event-live/" target="_blank">Amazon&rsquo;s event scheduled for later today</a>. They didn&rsquo;t provide a specific launch date for the Arc, the Android tablet, but at least they gave us prices and told us what month it was&nbsp;coming out.</p>
<p>Why is it that Apple and Amazon seem to be&nbsp;the only companies able to wait until a product is ready to be sold before they announce it? Nothing, and I mean, <strong><em>NOTHING</em></strong>, is more excruciatingly frustrating as a consumer and a tech enthusiast than to listen to an entire announcement about an amazing product, only to be&nbsp;left hanging, waiting for the two most important details: when can I buy it, and how much does it cost?&nbsp;Does announcing a product before the company has even decided how much they are going to charge for it actually help to increase sales? I know that beating Apple out of the gate has to be&nbsp;good idea, but announcing a phone or tablet without a price or a launch date is like jumping the gun and then tripping and falling on your face. You&rsquo;re not going to win the race, even if you are a better runner.&nbsp;In my humble&nbsp;opinion, announcing a product before it is ready to be launched screams insecurity. Your company is saying that you really don&rsquo;t think you can compete head-to-head with another company&rsquo;s product, so you have to announce yours first, or you&rsquo;ll lose in the long run. That doesn&rsquo;t make me want to buy your product. That makes me want to kick you in the shins.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>End rant.</p>
