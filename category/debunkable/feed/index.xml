<p dir="ltr">All right, well before we jump into your questions, we have a guest in the studio, Mike Khalil.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mike Khalil is the SAInT Academy Coordinator at Sandalwood High School here in Jacksonville, Florida. Welcome to the show Mike.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tell us first, what does SAInT in SAInT Academy stand for? Looking at your logo it looks like most of the letters in SAInT are in all caps?</p>
<p dir="ltr">What is an information technology academy?</p>
<p dir="ltr">And, what is it that you teach in the Academy?</p>
<p dir="ltr">How did the program begin?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Are the kids able to do hands-on work?</p>
<p dir="ltr">What are some of the benefits for students?</p>
<p dir="ltr">How do people and businesses in the community get involved?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Do students get college credit for the courses?</p>
<p dir="ltr">How do students get into the SAInT Academy? Is it a Magnet program?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://xkcd.com/627/">XKCD How to be a computer expert flowchart</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p dir="ltr">SAINT Academy is a program that allows students to fully experience high school while gaining skills in business and information technology. They earn a regular diploma, attend a regular neighborhood school, and attend regular classes. They take one or two computer-based electives per year, and get opportunities to compete against other students and meet important people in the community who can help them attain their college and career goals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We recruit 8th graders while they are in middle school, and they begin the program in 9th grade, they stay in the program all throughout high school. It&rsquo;s not just an elective, but a career-themed academy where we help students prepare for college and the workforce &mdash; writing resumes, interview skills, things like that, but since it&rsquo;s IT it&rsquo;s a little but different from most vocational academies. We&rsquo;re fully aware that most IT workers go to college; it&rsquo;s very hard to get a job in the field without a college degree, so we&rsquo;re very focused on Academics as well as vocational study, and most our students in fact are in honors or AP classes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alright, thanks for coming in Mike. Before we let you go, where can people find out more information about the SAInT Academy?</p>
<p dir="ltr">SAINT web site: <a href="http://sandalwoodhigh.org/">http://sandalwoodhigh.org/</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Thanks again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alright, well, we have to take a quick break, but when we come back we have answers to your tech questions, a Debunkable segment, and we finally have a name for the App segment.&nbsp;You&rsquo;re listening to Deemable Tech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So we have a question that we answered a long time ago, but I&rsquo;m not sure if we ever told the listener the answer! They sent us another email about it, and I couldn&rsquo;t find the question in our previous show notes, so let&rsquo;s answer it again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maliery writes: I was recently given the opportunity of updating my system. Ever since, whenever I send text messages, post on Facebook, or even write on the S note, my text all of a sudden gets erased. It&rsquo;s similar to a CTRL+a action, but I do not perform this step. Also, my google keyboard fails after of number of selections of the predictive messages. I think if I select 5/6 words, it will stop working. None of things ever happened when I was using the prior Jelly Bean update.&nbsp;Galaxy S III</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: First of all, I have a question for you:</p>
<p dir="ltr">* Jen from ?The IT Crowd&rsquo;: Have you tried turning it off and on. *</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yeah, the number one thing I would try is to reset your phone. Just hold down the power button while the phone is on. When the device options pop-up appears select reset and let the phone do its thing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hopefully that will clear it up. If you are using a keyboard other than the default keyboard, you can go to that application under Settings &gt; Application Manager and then clear the cache. That will delete all the data stored for the keyboard and if there&rsquo;s corrupt data it will get rid of it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If none of these solutions work, I would try using a different keyboard app. Android phones allow you to change what keyboard app you use. There are a couple preinstalled on your Samsung Galaxy S3. From the home screen hit the menu button, select settings, and then find ?Language and input&rsquo;. You can change what keyboards are enabled and select a default from this menu.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can download alternate keyboards. A couple popular keyboard apps are the SwiftKey and the Google Keyboard. I highly recommend the SwiftKey app. It costs about two bucks but its amazing. I highly recommend it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is also Swype, but for some reason you have to sideload that app, typically by downloading it to a laptop, connecting your phone, and installing. But I find that SwiftKey does everything Swype does and more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">RAY: So, to sum up &ndash; reboot the phone. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, clear the cache for your keyboard app under the Application Manager. If you are still having problems, try a different keyboard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: Those are my suggestions. I&rsquo;ll be honest, Maliery&rsquo;s problem is kind of a weird one. If none of those work it might be an issue with the phone itself. You may need to be prepared to take it back to the store. But before you get to the nuclear options, you should definitely try these ideas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, we&rsquo;ve been seeing this alot on Facebook and we had to investigate it.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">DEBUNKABLE</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://kyeos.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/warning-if-you-take-photos-with-your-cell-phone/">http://kyeos.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/warning-if-you-take-photos-with-your-cell-phone/</a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">?Warning? If you, your kids or grand kids take pics from your phone?WATCH THIS!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">This is truly alarming ? please take the time to watch. At the end they&rsquo;ll tell you how to set your phone so you don&rsquo;t run this risk!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">PLEASE PASS THIS INFO TO ANYONE YOU KNOW WHO TAKES PICTURES WITH THEIR CELL OR SMART PHONE AND POSTS THEM ONLINE.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">I want everyone of you to watch this and then be sure to share with all your family and friends.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">It&rsquo;s REALLY important info, about what your posting things on your cell phones can do TO YOU!!!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">Too much technology out there these days so beware???..</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO WATCH THIS VIDEO, AND TAKE THE RECOMMENDED PRECAUTIONS.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">If you have children or grandchildren you NEED to watch this. I had no idea this could happen from taking pictures on the blackberry or cell phone. It&rsquo;s scary.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">Any time something is that important that we HAVE to watch it now, well we have to watch it now. Here&rsquo;s a clip from the video:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="padding-left: 30px;">Play Audio from Video</p>
<p dir="ltr">&hellip;home, work, or even school of the person in the pic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">OK, let&rsquo;s pause it right there. First of all, this isn&rsquo;t new technology. This has been around for quite a few years. At least as far back as when the first iPhone came out. The video itself is from 2010. Second of all, no, they cannot find the home, work or even school of the person in the pic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Classic news fear mongering&nbsp;Legitimate concern, blown way out of proportion</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have geo-tagging turned on the location where you took the picture is stored in the picture. Geo-tagging is not the scariest thing in the world, Geo-tagging can be great. Have you ever pulled out a picture from a shoe box and wondered, now where was that taken? With geo-tagging, you don&rsquo;t have to wonder. It tells you where it was taken. So, with some apps, you can use your photos like a map on a road trip.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, yes, if you take pictures in your bedroom, park, school, work, then yes, someone who knows how to take GPS coordinates and convert them into locations on a map will be able to figure out where that picture was taken. Not many people know how to do that. Fortunately, most stalkers and creeps don&rsquo;t know how to do that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But, then the good folks at 41 Action News make sure that the creeps know how to do it</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2vARzvWxwY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://icanstalku.com/">icanstalku.com</a> is a great site with good information on how to disable geo-tagging services on your smart phone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you do want to disable location services on your photos, here&rsquo;s how you do it on your iPhone. and on your Android&hellip;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Android</p>
<p dir="ltr">All you need to do is fire up your camera app, and then go to settings. Depending on what phone you have, you may need to tap a gear icon, slide the settings out from the edge of your phone, or hit the settings button on your phone. Regardless, you should see an ?Store GPS&rsquo; or ?Store location&rsquo; setting. Turn it off.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The reality is, it&rsquo;s a lot easier for a kidnapper, or worse, to just grab a kid. I haven&rsquo;t heard of any cases where this has been done. Usually, the attacker is known to the child or it&rsquo;s just a random act. So, while it&rsquo;s smart to be aware of what information you are inadvertently posting about your child that could possibly be used to harm him or her, it isn&rsquo;t something that should invoke terror in your heart. This isn&rsquo;t really that dangerous.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>My son recently gave his mother an iPad 4 as a birthday gift he bought earlier this year because he wanted an iPad mini instead</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">What&rsquo;s the best way to delete all his data and accounts on the iPad 4 without him losing all his saved email, contacts, iTunes, Apps etc.? Both Ipads are still registered under his accounts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Erase All Content and Settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;Make sure to backup and sync the iPad 4 before you do that because if you forgot to get anything off of it, you&rsquo;re not getting it after you do that!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve got a voicemail from a listener. Let&rsquo;s play that.<br>
[Play voicemail]<br>
TOM: Okay, Ray, two phone lines on one iPhone. Can she do it?<br>
RAY: No. At least, not without major modifications to her phone at a hardware level. She would need a second sim card in her phone, and the iPhone 4 doesn&rsquo;t support dual sim cards.<br>
TOM: You might possibly be able to find some overseas company that does modifications like that&hellip;<br>
RAY: But that&rsquo;s probably not a good idea. I just think this is the wrong way to approach her problem.<br>
TOM: I agree. Basically she wants to have a way to filter out certain phone calls. The most obvious solution I can think of is: buy a second phone. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be an iPhone. Just go out and get yourself a $20 pre-paid feature phone. You can give people that number and just check it every so often.<br>
RAY: Yeah, that was my thought too.<br>
TOM: Alternatively, there she could block the calls.<br>
RAY: Yep. unfortunately there&rsquo;s no built in way to block a call. You can do it through your carrier or you can jailbreak it to automatically ignore calls from certain callers.<br>
There is a way to have two phone numbers that go to one phone though through Google Voice.<br>

<p>Ardis asked,</p>
<p>Dear Deemable Duo,<br>
I&rsquo;ve recently been having some issues scheduling D&amp;D games due to the busy lives of my fellow dice rollers. I&rsquo;m sure you find the idea of D&amp;D players having lives as shocking as I do, but regardless, if games are to continue we need to find some way around this problem. I was wondering if there was any kind of program that might make it easier to coordinate our schedules? Not necessarily something that will show our full schedules but something that could let us see what free time we have in common or something to that effect. Thank you for whatever insight you might be able to give.<b id="internal-source-marker_0.4077608031220734"><br></b></p>
<p><strong>What do you recommend for Ardis? Leave your suggestion in the comments down below. Thanks!</strong></p></body></html>

<p>You probably shouldn&rsquo;t even listen to this week&rsquo;s episode; it&rsquo;s too much for you to handle. This week&rsquo;s very special Halloween episode is the creepiest, grossest and scariest episode of Deemable Tech ever!&nbsp;If you dare, you&rsquo;ll hear all about zombie computers, how to send tweets and Facebook posts from beyond the grave, what to do with your digital estate, how to recover passwords from our departed relatives, how your cell phone is probably going to kill you, or at least make you really sick, new high-tech grave markers, and folks who chose to commit virtual (social media) suicide and others who plan on living forever and are using the Internet to try to make it happen. All that, and Ray tries his best Bela Lugosi impression, on this episode of Deemable Tech!</p>

<html><body><p>This morning I received an email forward with a lovely little critter inside:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Subject:</strong> Oh&hellip;my&hellip;gosh</p>
<p>This is revolting, and if I could find a way to bring up the one I drank I would&hellip;Oh boy, there is not a thing safe left to eat or drink anymore. GROUND BUGS FOR FOOD COLORING? YUCK!!! <a title="Report: Starbucks Frappuccinos Dyed with Crushed Up Bugs |  XFINITY News Blog by Comcast" href="http://xfinity.comcast.net/blogs/news/2012/03/27/report-starbucks-frappuccinos-dyed-with-crushed-up-bugs/" target="_blank">http://xfinity.comcast.net/blogs/news/2012/03/27/report-starbucks-frappuccinos-dyed-with-crushed-up-bugs/</a></p>
<p>Read the article to the bottom, guys. Besides being absolutely stomach churning (in our opinion) it is not okay for the health.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="//wp-content/uploads/2012/03/cochineal-e1332966093347.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-5156" title="Cochineal - The little critter that makes your Frappuccino so pretty!" src="//wp-content/uploads/2012/03/cochineal-e1332966093347-150x150.jpg"  alt="" width="150" height="150"></a>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the article on the <a href="http://xfinity.comcast.net/blogs/news/">Xfinity News Blog</a>, Starbucks has changed the recipe for the Strawberry Frappuccino, and it now includes the tasty little morsel above, called the cochineal bug. The cochineal extract &rdquo;&nbsp;is a red dye made of ground up bodies of cochineal insects.&rdquo; The article goes on to&nbsp;explain that &ldquo;this change was apparently made in an effort to reduce Starbucks&rsquo; use of artificial ingredients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story is true.&nbsp;<a title="Beware: Starbucks' Soy Strawberries &amp; Creme Frappuccino is NOT vegan " href="http://www.thisdishisvegetarian.com/2012/03/beware-starbucks-soy-strawberries-creme.html" target="_blank">This Dish Is Veg</a>&nbsp;was tipped off by a barista that the Strawberry Frappuccinos were no longer vegan.</p>
<p>Now, if that grosses you out, get ready for this: we&rsquo;ve been eating these&nbsp;crushed up cochineal bug shells for decades! Starbucks isn&rsquo;t the first company to use cochineal extract to dye food red; it has been being used in food for thousands of years. Ever had a Dannon&rsquo;s Activia yogurt, a Good N&rsquo; Plenty, a Pixi Stick, or a refreshing glass of Tropicana Ruby Red Grapefruit juice? Didn&rsquo;t those bugs taste yummy? These are just a <em>tiny</em> sample of the thousands of products on America&rsquo;s grocery shelves that contain carmine or cochineal extract.</p>
<p>Cochineal extract&nbsp;has no detectable flavor and it is safe for human consumption, except for a small number of people who are allergic to it. Any food that has &ldquo;Artificial color&rdquo; listed as one of the ingredients and is red to purple in color most likely contains cochineal extract. The FDA did not require it to be listed in the food ingredients (remember cochineal extract has been around since before the United States, let alone the FDA, even existed) until a law was passed in 2009 requiring companies to include it. So, while it certainly isn&rsquo;t kosher or vegan,&nbsp;cochineal extract&nbsp;is at least as safe to eat as peanuts or strawberries.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of the squeamishness of the subject, even though food companies have used cochineal extract for decades (Hershey&rsquo;s, Nestle, and Old Orchard Juices to name a few), some companies have started switching to Red #40 which is a completely artificial chemical that has, at least anecdotally, been linked to depression, hives, hyperactivity, and abdominal discomfort. (Of course, there hasn&rsquo;t been substantial research into whether there is a direct link, and there probably won&rsquo;t ever be because there isn&rsquo;t any money to be made in finding out that it is harmful.)</p>
<p>So, sometimes the solution might be worse than the problem. For me, I&rsquo;ll keep my crunchy bug shells. If I didn&rsquo;t notice them before,&nbsp;they won&rsquo;t bother me now. Mmm&hellip;now I&rsquo;m craving a Strawberry Frappuccino.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the gang at Sourcefed had to say about the news:</p>
