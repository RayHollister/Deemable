In Sean&rsquo;s absence they talked about Google&rsquo;s unsurprising announcement that the next version of Android will be &ldquo;M&rdquo; and the surprise announcement that Android is getting HBO Now&hellip; sometime later. Ray and Tom also talked about a text message that will make&nbsp;iPhones crash, presidential 404 pages, Jony Ive&rsquo;s new promotion and, on a more serious note, Ross Ulbrich&rsquo;s sentence to life in prison for his involvement in Silk Road.</p>

<h3>Android to get HBO Now&hellip; later</h3>
<p>At the Google I/O conference this week, Google VP Sundar Pichai <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2F2015%2F05%2F28%2Fhbo-now-is-coming-to-android-and-chromecast%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHYPuTxizVk4QjMVtndkWHPq7GYqQ">announced that HBO Now is coming to Android devices</a>. While a specific date has not been announced, Pichai mentioned that it would be available in time for season 2 of True Detective, which debuts on June 21st. HBO Now will be available as an app and will be compatible with the Chromecast.</p>
<p>Apple was believed to have a window of exclusivity with regards to the HBO Now service; it is clear that that window is now coming to a close.</p>
<p>Reddit User <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FDeemable%2Fcomments%2F37mbnh%2Fhbo_now_coming_to_android%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFP9TAQROiejc90qVefYr8yt1A_kg">PeanutButterShutter commented</a>, &ldquo;There is a God and his name is Google.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Apple is trying to look at things a little closer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2015%2F04%2F30%2Fapple-looking-into-built-in-telephoto-iphone-camera-lenses%2F%23.8rtsv0%3ALw2W&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5ud1IpATM83mVK08Vbu6rtw-3WA">Apple has filed a patent for a built-in telephoto camera</a>&nbsp;for a possible future iPhone. Instead of adding lenses to the existing camera, the patent proposes a solution that would add an additional camera to the device. So you would have a regular camera and a telephoto camera. The telephoto camera would have a much narrower field of view, but also a much higher magnification factor.</p>
<p>Of course, just because Apple has filed for a patent doesn&rsquo;t mean that we will ever see it come to fruition in an Apple product. Apple has an incredible amount of patents that have never seen the light of day as a real product. Apple currently has a patent for bayonet-style camera lens attachments for the iPhone and iPad, a patent for an iPhone with interchangeable lenses and even <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2015%2F03%2F24%2Fapple-patents-a-light-splitting-iphone-camera-sensor-system%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEryJXL40_C4xKy_QAK3SF3h9YVMQ">an iPhone with multiple camera sensors and beam splitters</a>&nbsp;to separate the blue, red and green light spectrum.</p>
<h3>Google announces Android M</h3>
<p>Surprising absolutely no one, Google also announced at Google I/O that the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2015%2F5%2F28%2F8675257%2Fandroid-m-os-update-google-io-2015&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFx6Rc5k1OiFPIocK-QCLJyLZpOg">next iteration of its Android operating system</a>&nbsp;will be coming out this year and that it will be code-named &lsquo;M&rsquo;, in keeping with the alphabetical theme of previous releases. What is not known is what delicious, sugary treat &lsquo;M&rsquo; will stand for. Android &lsquo;K&rsquo; turned out to stand for Kit Kat and the current version of the system, &lsquo;L&rsquo;, is Lollipop. The word on the street is that &lsquo;M&rsquo; will stand for Macadamia Nut Cookie, but we hasten to add that this is pure speculation.</p>
<p>Oh, you want &lsquo;substance&rsquo; to your news reports? Fine. While previous releases have focused on upgrades to the system&rsquo;s design, performance and battery life, &lsquo;M&rsquo; promises a focus on the basics: stability and usability. Google also says that M will give users the ability to grant permissions to apps on a case-by-case basis. Interestingly, this ability was present in earlier versions of the Android OS but was intended for developer use only and was eventually disabled. iOS users have enjoyed so-called &lsquo;granular permissions&rsquo; for years.</p>
<p>This is one case where we are glad to see Google taking a page from Apple&rsquo;s playbook.</p>
<h3>Jony Ive becomes Apple Chief Design Officer.</h3>
<p>Jony Ive is stepping down? or is it stepping up? Let&rsquo;s call it stepping away from ? the day to day routine at Apple. Jony Ive as you may know has been the Senior Vice President of Design at Apple for quite some time. Jony is the man behind most of the iconic designs that have come out of Cupertino. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2015%2F05%2F25%2Fjony-ive-chief-design-officer%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFO8vNqL5jgWY4oMbwXG1bXrFatUw">Jony is now the Chief Design Officer at Apple</a>. Which is safe to assume means that he will have less to do with the day to day management. Richard Howarth is taking over as vice president of Industrial Design, and Alan Dye is the new vice president of User Interface Design, two departments that Ive was overseeing at the same time. Now Ive can focus on overseeing design, and potentially spend more time at home with the family.</p>
<h3>Silk Road Founder Gets Life</h3>
<p>Ross Ulbrich, founder and operator of the notorious dark net drug market The Silk Road, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2015%2F5%2F29%2F8687583%2Fprison-sentence-ross-ulbricht-guilty-silk-road-dread-pirate-roberts&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE-iR8Xj7I2FNhXInZqXh-pCG4H3w">was sentenced this week to life in prison</a>. Ulbricht, alias The Dread Pirate Roberts, was tried and found guilty narcotics conspiracy and other charges earlier in the year. The minimum possible sentence that he faced was twenty years, a term that he and his lawyers had pleaded for.</p>
<p>During the sentencing hearing the court heard several accounts of people who had become hooked on drugs or even overdosed on drugs obtained through the Silk Road. Ulbricht&rsquo;s failed attempts to order hits on other members of the Silk Road community probably did not help his case either.</p>
<p>His life sentence comes without the possibility of parole. Barring a successful appeal, Ulbricht will die behind bars.</p>
<h3>The text message that will reboot your iPhone</h3>
<p>This next story sounds like it must be an urban legend, but it is not: there is a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fsecurity%2F2015%2F05%2Fbeware-of-the-text-message-that-crashes-iphones%2F%23p3&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2tqtxxEAZyV_-JQNLR2JgDSEG6g">text message that, if you send it to a friend with an iPhone, may cause their phone to reboot</a>.</p>
<p>OK, you are probably waiting breathlessly for us to tell you what the message is, but here is the thing, we can&rsquo;t tell you, because it is gibberish: it involves a lot of special characters from other language character sets. The first two words are in English, however, and they are &lsquo;effective. Power&rsquo;. So we can call this the &lsquo;effective. Power&rsquo; bug.</p>
<p>From what we are hearing, the &lsquo;effective. Power&rsquo; bug happens when an iPhone attempts to display a shortened version of this message in the notifications. The iPhone will then reset if your phone is locked. Otherwise your phone&rsquo;s screen will go black. That is the only effect, it is basically harmless. You can clear it out <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Fheres-apples-temporary-fix-for-its-iphone-crashing-mess-1707633642%3Futm_campaign%3Dsocialflow_gizmodo_facebook%26utm_source%3Dgizmodo_facebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocialflow&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGHsKnjFnE6INbCBYAvMWlepqIefg">by asking Siri to read unread messages</a>, and then using Siri to reply to the person that sent the offending text.</p>
<p>Early reports indicated that turning off text message notifications would disable the bug but some users are reporting that it still works even with notifications disabled.</p>
<p>While Apple is working on an iOS fix, as of this recording one has not yet been released. However, something else really interesting has happened. Tonight as we were attempting to test and verify this bug, we found that we could not send each other the message! It simply will not go through. It would appear that some carriers have wised up to this trick and may be blocking messages carrying the dangerous string of characters.</p>
<p>Regardless, be a cool friend and don&rsquo;t spam your friends with the &ldquo;effective. Power&rdquo; text.</p>
<h3>404 Candidate Not Found</h3>
<p>As candidates throw their hats in the ring for the 2016 presidential election, The Atlantic has identified one key issue that no one has looked at: <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2015%2F05%2Fcampaign-websites-and-404-pages%2F394187%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFR0W5L_UeyEo2NiFbDHrBsrE94Uw">whose campaign website has the best 404 page</a>. The 404 page is the page you see when you try to reach a page on a website that is broken or that no longer exists. The majority of the internet&rsquo;s websites produce uninspired 404 pages with stock text, but a few, like Twitter&rsquo;s famous &lsquo;fail whale&rsquo;, are memorable classics. If you think about it, this is exactly what America wants in its chief executive: the ability to remain cool in a crisis, maybe crack a joke or two. And being unable to find the web page you need? That is definitely a crisis. So, Ray, with your permission I thought we would visit a handful of the announced candidates&rsquo; campaign sites and 404 it up.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Florida&nbsp;residents will be able to purchase extremely fast Internet service, starting next month. A handful of Florida cities, including Jacksonville, are among the nation?s first where Comcast is bringing fiber-optic Internet to people?s homes.</span></p>
<p>The new Internet service called Gigabit Pro is faster than anything currently available in Florida. That means customers could download the equivalent of a feature-length film in about 15 seconds versus the average 25 minutes it takes a current Comcast customer to download the same file.</p>
<p>A Comcast rep declined to give pricing on the service, which launches next month. She did say customers would be responsible for installation fees so Comcast can dig in yards and install the fiber-optic cables. And to get this new service, customers must live within a third of a mile of existing Comcast fiber cables.</p>
<p>A much slower service Comcast offers, called Extreme 505, runs about $400 a month. Extreme 505, runs at more than ten-times faster than what most customers have in the state of Florida but only a quarter of the speed of Gigabit Pro.</p>

<h2>This Week&rsquo;s Run Down</h2>
<h3>Season 3 of House of Cards leaks out early</h3>
<p>Season 3 of the critically acclaimed Netflix original show House of Cards is scheduled to come out on Feb. 27th, but fans got an accidental sneak peek on Tuesday when the first ten episodes appeared on the streaming TV service early. Netflix quickly pulled it, but those who were already streaming an episode were able to continue to do so as long as they did not stop until the episode ended. Netflix kept a good sense of humor about it, tweeting ?This is Washington. There is always a leak.? Fans can binge on the twisted schemes of the conniving Frank Underwood starting February 27th.</p>

<h3>Jeb Bush accidentally doxes thousands of Floridians</h3>
<p>In his words, &ldquo;In the spirit of transparency,&rdquo; presidential candidate Jeb Bush released emails from when he was governor of Florida. Unfortunately, the sensitive information like Social security numbers, addresses, phone numbers and Credit Card numbers were not redacted from the emails. So, his team basically just accidentally doxed thousands of Floridians.</p>

<h3>Jeb Bush&rsquo;s CTO resigns over controversial tweets</h3>
<p>Chief Technical Officer for Jeb Bush&rsquo;s presidential campaign resigned Tuesday after it came out in the media that Ethan Czahor posted several sexist and racist jokes on Twitter several years ago. He did delete them before starting to work for Bush, but the backlash was apparently too intense.</p>
<p>Kristy Campbell, a spokeswoman for Bush says, &ldquo;While Ethan has apologized for regrettable and insensitive comments, they do not reflect the views of Gov. Bush or his organization and it is appropriate for him to step aside. We wish him the best.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Snapchat selfie leads to first degree murder charge</h3>
<p>A Pennsylvania 16-year-old has been charged with first degree murder after posting a selfie on Snapchat with the dead victim.</p>
<p>Snapchat messages delete themselves after a short period of time, but the person who received the picture saved it before it deleted itself.</p>

<h3>Facebook makes plans for the afterlife</h3>
<p>Facebook has announced new features that allow users to designate a very special Facebook Friend to administer their profile after they die. Before when a Facebook user died there were only two options for their account: permanent deletion or ?memorialization?. Memorialized accounts were frozen in time and could not be accessed, even by immediate family members.</p>
<p>Facebook?s new features will let the ?legacy contact? have SOME control over the memorialized profile. Among other things they will be able to post at the top of the deceased timeline, according to Facebook, ?to announce a memorial service or share a special message.? They can also approve or deny friend requests and update profile pictures.</p>
<p>What they cannot do is access the deceased? private messages. Some secrets, it seems, you take to the grave.</p>

<html><body><p>It&rsquo;s officially summer &ndash; the kids are out of school, the weather is fine, and for many of us it&rsquo;s time to travel. We here at Deemable Tech are planning vacations of our own, and we&rsquo;ve got some really useful tools to help make things easier.<span id="more-8888"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_8894" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2014/06/atlas_obscura.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-8894 size-full" src="/media/2014/06/atlas_obscura.png"  alt="Image credit: Atlas Obscura" width="300" height="260"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Atlas Obscura</p></div>
<p>Here, in no particular order, are some of our favorite vacation planning websites:</p>
<p><a href="http://optionsaway.com/" target="_blank"><strong>OptionsAway.com</strong></a> &ndash; Sometimes when you&rsquo;re looking to buy an airline ticket, you might find a price you really like early on but aren&rsquo;t quite prepared to buy. For a fee, Options Away lets you put a hold on that price for up to 21 days and buy it later, even if it has increased on other sites. Fees start at $4 for holding the price for a day to about $20 for 21 days. We should note that they currently only offer their services for flights within the continental U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p><a href="http://peek.com/perfectday/" target="_blank"><b>Peek.com</b></a> &ndash; Peek mainly focuses on offering curated packages for attractions in selected cities like Paris, London and New York City, but the reason we included it on this list is their <a href="http://peek.com/perfectday/" target="_blank">Perfect Days</a> section. Here, users can submit their &ldquo;perfect day&rdquo; in a city with a day&rsquo;s worth of suggestions activities. For example, a user might suggest visiting a certain cafe for breakfast, taking a bike ride along a particular river, shopping at local boutique, etc. It&rsquo;s a great free way to plan a vacation day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tingo.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Tingo.com</strong></a> &ndash; Have you ever booked a hotel room online only to see the price drop a few days later? When you book through Tingo and the price drops, they will actually refund the deference to your credit card. Tingo also offers free upgrades, so if you pay for a room and a better one opens for the same price they will automatically give you that upgraded room. We&rsquo;re not entirely sure how the site makes money as no fees are listed, but we love the idea.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/" target="_blank">AtlasObscura.com </a>&ndash;&nbsp;</strong>If you like to travel but don&rsquo;t like tourists, Atlas Obscura is a good way to get off the beaten path. The site is sort of a Wikipedia for the sights most travelers won&rsquo;t know about; simply enter a city to find nearby stuff you would never thought to look for. You can also use Atlas Obscura to come up with great staycation ideas for when you want to try something new at home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.booking.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Booking.com</strong></a>&nbsp;&ndash; Finding a hotel room in a city where a major event is happening &ndash; like San Diego during Comic-Con &ndash; can be practically impossible. This doesn&rsquo;t stop Booking.com from finding vacant rooms, though, even just days before the event and for rates comparable to other sites. We don&rsquo;t know how they do it, but our bet is on some kind of black magic.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hipmunk.com/" target="_blank"><b>Hipmunk.com</b> </a>&ndash; There are dozens of sites for booking airline tickets, but Hipmunk is one of the few we&rsquo;ve seen that realizes that price isn&rsquo;t the only thing that matters when you fly. When you search, Hipmunk displays the results in an easy to understand grid that shows the length of each of flight, how long any layovers are and even whether or not the plane has WiFi (it also, of course, shows the price). We&rsquo;re also intrigued by the fact that it lets you sort those results by &ldquo;agony&rdquo; &ndash; direct&nbsp;flights are listed first, then ones with longer and longer layovers. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that the site has an adorable mascot as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.befrugal.com/tools/fly-or-drive-calculator/" target="_blank"><b>BeFrugal.com&rsquo;s Fly or Drive Calculator</b></a> &ndash; An important thing to consider when you&rsquo;re planning a trip is whether you should fly or if it would be cheaper to drive to your destination. Be Frugal&rsquo;s Fly or Drive Calculator not only calculates your trip using the price of gas and the cost of an airline ticket, but also takes things like car rentals into consideration.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter.com</strong> </a>&ndash;&nbsp;OK, OK. We know Twitter&rsquo;s not really a travel site, but we wanted to include it because it can be helpful when dealing with travel companies. For example, most airlines have whole customer service teams that just monitor Twitter for tweets about their flights and&nbsp;complaints from passengers. We&rsquo;ve heard many stories of someone&nbsp;tweeting an airline about something they&rsquo;re not happy about (like the plane being too hot) and the customer service team contacting that individual flight to resolve the problem.</p>

<html><body><p>Spring semester is in full swing for college students around the world and the Class of 2014 will be entering the job market in mere months. Unemployment rates are still scary at <a title="Bureau of Labor Statistics" href="http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000" target="_blank">6.7%</a>&nbsp;but there are ways to improve the likelihood of landing an interview. If you are planning to enter the job market in the coming months, here&rsquo;s how to position yourself on <a title="LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/2014/01/can-linkedin-profile-help-new-professionals/linkedin_sq/" rel="attachment wp-att-8554"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8554" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 25px;" alt="New Professional LinkedIn" src="/media/2014/01/LinkedIn_sq-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300"></a></p>
<h4><strong>Create a profile.</strong></h4>
<p><strong></strong>Use a permanent personal email account. You can add your work or school email after you&rsquo;ve set up your profile. LinkedIn will suggest you import your email contacts each time you add an email address. Be aware if you do import your contacts, LinkedIn may send them a connection request. This can be a problem if you do not update your contact list. It&rsquo;s better to connect with people on an individual basis rather than en masse.</p>
<h4><strong>Upload a headshot.</strong></h4>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words and yours should express your personality while appealing to employers in your industry. You can improve your personal brand by using the same picture across your social media accounts. Your Twitter account with thoughtful posts about industry trends can confirm to potential employers that they&rsquo;ve found the right person.</p>
<h4><strong>Craft an SEO-approved headline.&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>LinkedIn gives you 120 characters to sell yourself. Use that space to squeeze in some industry keywords. Are you actively seeking employment? Consider starting your headline with &ldquo;Seeking Employment As [Insert Job Title].&rdquo;Now that you have started setting up your LinkedIn profile, adjust your privacy settings. Turn off broadcast of your activity while making frequent changes to your profile. You can turn this feature on again when you are ready to announce new positions or skills.</p>
<h4><strong>Explain your personal brand in the Summary.</strong></h4>
<p>Use this space to introduce yourself to future employers or clients. You have 2,000 characters to present your story. Keep it professional and remember to use keywords common to your desired profession.</p>
<h4><strong>Add current and previous positions.</strong></h4>
<p>LinkedIn allows you to add as much of your work history as you desire. Focus on the jobs you enjoyed most and the ones that showcase skills you want to utilize in the future.</p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re ready to start adding connections. Not sure how to build a strong network? Check back for Part 2: Building a Solid LinkedIn Network.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>
<p>TOM: From WJCT studios in Jacksonville, Florida, I&rsquo;m Tom Braun, in for Ray Hollister,</p>
<p>ELIZABETH: I&rsquo;m Elizabeth Pampalone, in for Tom Braun</p>
<p>TOM: and this is Deemable Tech. This week&rsquo;s episode is brought to you by A Small Orange, Homegrown Hosting. A refreshingly different approach to web hosting. On the web at a small orange dot com.</p>
<p>ELIZABETH: Got a question about your computer, smart phone, tablet or the Internet? You can give us a call us at One Eight Eight Eight, Nine Seven Two, Nine Eight Six Eight, or send us an email at questions@deemable.com.</p>
<p>TOM: Well, as you can tell, Ray is not here again this week. Thankfully this time it&rsquo;s not because he&rsquo;s having an appendectomy like a few weeks ago. This time it&rsquo;s actually because of something great: Ray and his wife just had their second child!</p>
<p>So congratulations to Ray! He&rsquo;ll be back soon. And thank you Elizabeth for stepping in to help us out this week.</p>
<p>ELIZABETH: Happy to be here!</p>
<p>TOM: And also back again this week is our producer Sean Birch.</p>
<p>SEAN: Hello there!</p>
<p>TOM: And as we said on last week&rsquo;s show, we&rsquo;re changing things up a little bit here on the podcast. We realized that the people who listen to this and the people who listen to our segments on public radio aren&rsquo;t necessarily the same.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a specific plan just yet, but we do know that we won&rsquo;t be spending as much time answering questions on the podcast. We&rsquo;re still going to answer them, it just won&rsquo;t be as many. Instead we&rsquo;re going to try different things. And if you have suggestions for things you?d like to hear us try, let us know. Questions@deemable.com.</p>
<p>Before we dive into questions and other stuff, I got a call from a friend today with an interesting problem. Interesting to me, anyway, not so good for her.</p>
<p>She followed a page that had posted a story about a cat who had gotten lost and finally come home to its owners after six months. And she had posted a comment along the lines of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to let cats outside.&rdquo; Now that&rsquo;s a statement that you can agree or disagree with, but she posted it in a really non-confrontational way. Just a statement of opinion.</p>
<p>But some people who she didn&rsquo;t know who were not Facebook friends of hers started replying to this comment and saying really mean things. They were calling her names, saying she should be neutered, that she shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed out of the house, etc. And she was getting notifications about these comments. So she called me in a real tizzy wanting to make the notifications stop.</p>
<p>Basically, this is Facebook bullying. What are some steps my friend could take to stop it?</p>

<p>DRAFT TRANSCRIPT</p>
<p>RAY: From WJCT studios in Jacksonville, Florida, I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister,</p>
<p>TOM: I&rsquo;m Tom Braun,</p>
<p>RAY: and this is Deemable Tech, tech help worth listening to.</p>
<p>TOM: This week&rsquo;s episode of the Deemable Tech podcast is brought to you by A Small Orange, Homegrown Hosting. A refreshingly different approach to web hosting. On the web at a small orange dot com.</p>
<p>RAY: And if you haven&rsquo;t done so already, make sure to subscribe to the Deemable Tech podcast. Just go to iTunes and search for Deemable Tech, or go to <a href="http://deemable.com/itunes">deemable.com/itunes</a>&nbsp;to take you directly to our iTunes page. You can also subscribe to our YouTube page at <a href="http://youtube.com/DeemableTech">youtube.com/DeemableTech</a>. And we&rsquo;re on <a href="http://facebook.com/Deemable">the Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/Deemable">the Twitter</a>, just search for Deemable Tech.</p>
<p>TOM: Got a question about your computer, smart phone, tablet or the Internet? Give us a call us at One Eight Eight Eight, Nine Seven Two, Nine Eight Six Eight, or send us an email at questions@deemable.com.</p>
<p>RAY:</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve started a new <a href="http://http//deemable.com/2013/09/answer-a-survey-to-enter-to-win-a-20-amazon-gift-card/">Amazon Gift Card contest</a>. All you have to do is answer a few questions about the Deemable Tech podcast.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;s not a trivia contest. We just need your opinion on a few questions. If you could take a few minutes and answer our survey it will really help us out a lot. And, just for doing so, you&rsquo;ll be entered to win a $20 Amazon Gift Card.</p>
<p>Just go to Deemable.com and click the link to take the survey. You can&rsquo;t miss it, it will be the first or second article at the top of the page until the contest is over. Speaking of which, it ends September 30th, so don&rsquo;t wait, go submit&nbsp;your survey answers right now,&hellip; unless you&rsquo;re listening live, then wait until the show&rsquo;s over and then answer the questions.</p>
<p>Speaking of questions, Tom, do we have any questions?</p>
<p>TOM: Do we have any questions? Do we have any questions?! Yeah, we have questions. We have questions about how to wipe an iPhone, whether you should buy an AMD or an Intel laptop, the best way to host unique email addresses, and more.</p>
<p>RAY: Ooh ooh an we talk about our new toys?</p>
<p>TOM: OH, that?s right, we both have fun new gadgets. Ray has an iPhone 5S, and I?ve finally got my hands on the semi-mythical Chromebook. But first we?re going to dive into a couple of questions, starting with this one from Martha.</p>
<p>TOM: Martha writes, I am a middle school art teacher. My classroom is long and narrow and set up for for&nbsp;projection on the center of one of the long walls. With large classes of 44 students plus, nearly half of them cannot see the examples and demonstrations that I am projecting. Having 16 -20 students move their seats every time I want to show them something eats up too much class time. I am looking for a way to project the same image on the side and end wall at the same time &ndash; and of course on a school teachers budget. I have a laptop and an LCD projector. I thought about trying to add a TV to the set up. How? Will it work? Is there a better (and/or cheaper) option?<br>
Thanks guys!</p>
<p>RAY: It all depends on your setup Martha. I am assuming that you are connecting your laptop to your projector with a VGA cable. The end of a VGA cable looks like an upside-down trapezoid with 3 rows of 5 pins on it. That used to be&nbsp;the standard monitor/projector cable. If you&rsquo;re using HDMI or DVI then these instructions would be a little different.<br>
Many projectors have an extra VGA out port, so you can daisy chain them.</p>
<p>Let me explain what that means.</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll have to get a VGA splitter. You can find them for $10 to $20.</p>
<p>Now, if I was doing this, and I had an unlimited amount of money, I would hook up another projector on the other side of the room. But, since you mentioned that you&rsquo;re on a school teacher&rsquo;s budget, and, if I had to guess you&rsquo;re probably paying for this out of your own pocket, I expect you don&rsquo;t have a load of cash to throw it this problem.</p>
<p>You mentioned that you have a TV that you could add to the set up. That will most likely work, but you may have to buy adapters to connect the laptop to the television set. If you&rsquo;re really lucky, it might have a VGA in port on it. If you&rsquo;re not so lucky, you may have to buy an adapter, which can run anywhere from $50-$200 depending on which type of adapter you need.</p>
<p>Either way, you are going to need a cable to run from your laptop, or from the other projector, to the other side of the room where the TV or the other projector is going to be. 50 foot VGA cables run anywhere from $15-$60 online.</p>
<p>So, best case scenario this is going to cost you about $50. Worst case scenario it might cost you closer to $200.</p>
<p>I hope that helps. If that seems doable to you, but you need some more help, do us a favor and take a picture of the back of your laptop, and the back of the projector where you plug it in the laptop, and the back of the TV where the ports are. We will be able to tell you more specifically what exact cables and/or adapters you need. Email us those pictures at questions@Deemable.com and we&rsquo;ll take another look at it okay? Thanks.</p>
<p>Maliery writes, Are AMD processors the generic processors in comparison to Intel Celeron processors?<br>
I&rsquo;m shopping for a laptop, and I&rsquo;m finding that the price of the AMD is more alluring, but not more than the specs on a i5&nbsp;intel processor. If I bought an AMD processor (laptop), will I be disappointed when I visit my grandma, and she&rsquo;s playing Solitare&nbsp;on an i5?</p>
<p>Thanks for the question, Maliery.</p>
<p>The way you framed it makes me think you?re comparing, say, Tylenol to the generic store-brand stuff. Processors don?t work quite&nbsp;the same way. There can be a lot of little differences under the hood.</p>
<p>AMD had kind of a hay-day in the 90?s, and several desktops I owned then had AMD processors and could go toe-to-toe with more expensive Intel machines. But things have really changed. While AMD computers are often quite cheap these days, they just aren?t up to par with Intel machines.</p>
<p>I?m not just talking about performance, either. You?re generally going to see better battery life on Intel laptops versus AMD laptops. Intel chips do a much better job with power management. I also suspect that you?re just going to have a smoother overall experience with an Intel machine.</p>
<p>Even price doesn?t have to hold you back from buying Intel. I recently helped a friend shop for an Intel laptop that was under $500. Sure, there are some real bargain basement AMD laptops, but once you get down to the $250 range I?d start thinking about getting a Chromebook for that email-and-web-browsing laptop.</p>
<p>It is possible to get higher end AMD processors that have clock speeds on par with lower end Intel processors. But Intel simply makes a better chip, so unless you are planning on buying a laptop based on price alone I would not get an AMD.</p>

<p>Question: One of the icons on my iPad screen is called&nbsp;&ldquo;Notes&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a yellow legal pad app that I have used often to make notes in meetings. How do I print those notes off my iPad using my MG6220 Canon Printer? Thanks.</p>
<p>Fortunately your Printer is AirPrint ready. So you can automatically print from your iPad.</p>
<p>Just tap the Action button, which on iOS 6 is square with an arrow point sorta to the right. On iOS 7 it&rsquo;s a square with an arrow pointing up.</p>
<p>Walk through from there</p>

<p>BREAK</p>
<p>RAY: So, if you follow us on Twitter @Deemable, or if you follow me on Twitter @RayHollister, then you know that I spent Friday morning waiting in line at the Apple store for the iPhone 5S.</p>
<p>TOM: Now Ray, I know you are an Apple fan, but I thought you always said people that lined up overnight for the iPhone launches were idiots?</p>
<p>RAY: Oh, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still think they&rsquo;re idiots, I&rsquo;ve just accepted that I am one of them. All kidding aside, it was a lot of fun although it was exhausting. I got there at about 3:00 AM and got my iPhone 5S&nbsp;at just after 8:00, so it wasn&rsquo;t too bad, but I really didn&rsquo;t prepare for it. I was busy all day Thursday, so I was about to pass out from exhaustion by the time I got home. If you want to read the highlights, check out my Twitter feed @rayhollister.</p>
<p>TOM: So, what&rsquo;s your verdict? Was it worth the wait and the money?</p>
<p>RAY:<br>
TouchID works fantastic<br>
I never had a passcode&nbsp;on my iPhone before, like most people, but now I have a 35+ character passcode</p>
<p>It works almost every single time. The only time I have had a problem was when my fingers were wet, and I tried to unlock it.</p>
<p>The A7 processor is so snappy.<br>
Significantly faster than my iPhone 4S, and quite a bit faster than my friend&rsquo;s iPhone 5.<br>
The larger screen size took a little bit&nbsp;to get used to. Especially with my Megan Fox thubs.</p>
<p>Camera</p>
<p>Burst mode</p>
<p>SloMo</p>
<p>True Tone flash</p>
<p>New sounds, no more marimba</p>
<p>RAY: So Tom, I know that you also recently got a new toy, and I wondered if you wanted to talk about it a little bit.<br>
TOM: Does a geek want to talk about his new toy??? Does Tim Cook own an iPhone?<br>
RAY: OK, so tell us what it is.<br>
TOM: It?s a Chromecast.<br>
RAY: Now explain to our listeners what a Chromecast is.<br>
TOM: Basically a Chromecast&nbsp;is a little dongle that plugs into the HDMI port of your television. When connected to your home wifi network, any device that can run Google Chrome can send video and audio wirelessly directly to your TV.<br>
It works pretty well, and the kicker is that it?s $30.<br>
The Chromecast actually came out this summer, but at that low price they sold out within about 24 hours. I wasn?t one of the people in the first wave, but I went ahead and put it an order for one on Amazon.com.<br>
Right when Google announced the Chromecast I had actually been looking for ways to do exactly what it does: stream wireless video from my laptop to my TV. I probably stream video from my laptop 70% of the time I?m using my TV. I was getting tired of lugging my laptop into the living room and tripping over the eight foot HDMI cable I use to connect it.<br>
Google is not the first company to come up with a way to broadcast video from a computer to a TV.<br>
RAY: There?s Apple TV.<br>
TOM: Right, but you have to have&nbsp;a Mac, and I don?t. Some newer Intel-based laptops have a technology called WiDi&nbsp;which can do it, but my laptop unfortunately doesn?t have that either. There are a number of third party&nbsp;solutions out there, but they all have two big drawbacks: they all require line of sight to the TV, and they all start at $150 and go up from there.<br>
RAY: You can get AirParrot for Windows. It lets you broadcast video from your Mac or Windows PC to an Apple TV. It&rsquo;s only $9.99 for the program, but you still have to buy a $99 Apple TV.<br>
TOM: Right. So when Google announced that it had a $30 solution to this problem I definitely paid attention.<br>
RAY: Okay, so how does the Chromecast actually work? How do you set it up?<br>
TOM: *explains*<br>
RAY: Cool. Can you send any video to the TV with the Chromecast?<br>
TOM: No, you can?t send just anything. You have to have the Google Chrome browser installed, and that?s what?s going to talk to your television. But the nice thing is that Chrome is available for the PC, the Mac, Android and iDevices. So any of those can talk to the Chromecast.<br>
So far the only apps that have native support for Chromecast&nbsp;are YouTube, Netflix and Google Play. If you have any of those apps on your phone or tablet you should see a square Chromecast&nbsp;icon. Touching the icon will send whatever you?re playing to the Chromecast. This works very well. The Chromecast actually streams the video or audio, and your phone or tablet basically acts as the controller.<br>
RAY: But what about things that don?t have native Chromecast support?<br>
TOM: There is a Chromecast&nbsp;extension which you install on Chrome, and that puts a button on your browser that allows you to share any browser tab with Chromecast. So if your want to share something that doesn?t have Chromecast&nbsp;support yet you can still do that. For instance, Hulu doesn?t have native Chromecast&nbsp;support but you simply cast the tab you?re watching it in and it appears on your TV &ndash; with a second or so delay, granted.<br>
RAY: What about local files. Can you play movies that are on your hard drive?<br>
TOM: You can, at least on a Windows PC. You can actually play video files in Chrome, as long as they aren?t in a proprietary format. Windows Media Player?s WMV files and Apple?s MOV files won?t work, but file types like AVI and MP4 will open in a Chrome tab. And then you can share them to your Chromecast.<br>
Overall it works pretty well. Sometimes the interface&nbsp;is a little clunky and there can be&nbsp;a delay of a few seconds when starting a video. And of course it doesn?t support every video format. But for $30 I personally am willing to forgive a lot of those quirks.</p>

Ray, Tom-<br>
Howdy. Your listeners might be interested in https://www.sneakemail.com,/<br>
they provide a fair priced solution similar to what Amber and you do.<br>
-Hoff<br>
RAY: Last week Amber and I talked about how we use bestbuy@rayhollister.com, avenue@amberhollister.com etc.<br>
For folks without their own domain address Sneakemail.com works the same way. $2.00 per month, which is about the same price as a domain name without all the hassle.</p>

<p>Okay, don&rsquo;t laugh&hellip; I just found an old computer game CD-Rom designed for Windows 95/98. (I said don&rsquo;t laugh!) It&rsquo;s Scrabble, and it would be more convenient than online options sometimes, since I&rsquo;m in Africa. Anyway, will this thing work on my Windows XP (also outdated now, I know)? Will it crash my computer?<br>
Waiting anxiously for your response if I can get my Scrabble on!</p>
<p>RAY: It should work. Most likely you&rsquo;ll only need to put the disc in. However, you might have to run it in &ldquo;compatibility mode.&rdquo; Try it and see.</p>
<p>Dave writes, Hi.<br>
I have a Samsung Centura&nbsp;phone that accumulates frequently called<br>
numbers. This is something different from the regular call log which I<br>
can clear any time. The frequently called log is retaining _every_<br>
number I dial and I cannot find a way to delete/clear this log. In fact<br>
I would like to disable it altogether. Any help?<br>
Thanks very much.<br>
TOM: OK Dave, hopefully we can help you. We aren?t familiar with the Samsung Centura&nbsp;and we don?t have access to one, but we can tell you what the internet says about your problem. I searched for ?samsung centura frequently called numbers? and found someone complaining about the same issue. Another user said there is an app they can download that will do the trick.<br>
Try searching for and downloading the ?HistoryEraser? app from DUMAPIC in the Google Play Market.<br>
Once you have the app, select `Contacts`. Then, select target will say `All Frequently Called (in Favorites tab). Press `Ok` and they`re gone!<br>
As far as I can tell, the HistoryEraser&nbsp;app looks legit. But we haven?t tried it ourselves, so this is a little bit of a use-at-your-own-risk case. That said, if this issue is really driving you crazy it might worth trying.</p>
<p>Michael wrote on our Facebook page:</p>
<p>All of a sudden an icon called &ldquo;Homegroup&rdquo; appeared on my desktop. I didn&rsquo;t do anything I know of to get this, whatever it is. Have I been hacked or what? Is it safe and, if so, what for? And how did I get it? I&rsquo;m running Windows 8, but not on a touch screen.</p>
<p>RAY: Most likely it is safe. I haven&rsquo;t heard of any viruses or hacks involving Homegroup. You or someone on your network was most likely playing with file sharing settings. A homegroup&nbsp;is something that is setup on Windows 7 and 8 to allow you to share documents, photos, music, videos and printers with other people on your home network. You can set it up so that they make changes to your documents or set it up so all they can do is view them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to do anything about it, but if you want to get rid of it from your desktop, we&rsquo;ll include a link in our show notes with directions on how to remove the Homegroup&nbsp;icon from Windows 8 and how to remove the Homegroup icon from Windows 7 if any other listeners that have Windows 7 want to remove it as well.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I used to have a link to my email on my desktop, but somehow it got deleted. Now I search for my email on MSN. My son says I&rsquo;m doing things the long way. To be honest I don&rsquo;t know much about the web and I get a little bit overwhelmed every time I open Internet Explorer. Any advice?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Deep breaths, Kevin! It&rsquo;s going to be okay. We&rsquo;re here to help.</p>
<p>The good news is that you are definitely not alone here. We talk to people all the time who can&rsquo;t figure out how to get from Point A to Point B on their browser. When you open Internet Explorer you may see up to three different fields where you can type things. You know you want to go to a specific website, but where do you type it in?</p>
<p>What you want to do is type the URL into the address bar. URL stands for &ldquo;Uniform Resource Locator,&rdquo; which is just the formal name for a web address. For example, www.google.com and deemable.com are both URLs. Either way, they usually look like &ldquo;www.nameofthewebsite.com&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s a secret: 99% of the time you can leave off the &ldquo;www&rdquo;. You don&rsquo;t have to type &ldquo;www.google.com&rdquo;, you can just type &ldquo;google.com&rdquo; and your browser will figure out the rest.</p>
<p>The place you want to type it is not the search bar of the website that is your home page. That will search for any web page that references the name of the website. Granted, the web page itself will probably be the first search result, but you&rsquo;re adding an extra step. You want to type the web address, or URL, into the address bar, which is above the web page. You can identify it because it will have the address of the current page, usually prefixed by &ldquo;http://&rdquo;/ or &ldquo;https://&rdquo;/ (incidentally, you don&rsquo;t have to type &ldquo;http://&rdquo;/ either, because your browser will fill that in as well).</p>
<div id="attachment_7549" style="width: 537px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2013/07/bing.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class=" wp-image-7549 " alt="Telling the difference between a search box and your address bar can sometimes be a challenge, especially if you're new to surfing the Internet." src="/media/2013/07/bing-1024x544.png"  width="527" height="280"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Telling the difference between a search box and your address bar can sometimes be a challenge, especially if you&rsquo;re new to surfing the Internet.</p></div>
<p>There are a couple of things to be aware of. First, you may or may not have another field at the top of your browser that is for searching. Typing the web address into <em>that</em> field is just the same as if you went to Yahoo or Google or Bing and searched for the web address there. It&rsquo;s for searching, not for navigating directly to a website.</p>
<p>The other thing to be aware of is that in newer browsers the address field can also do web searches. So if you type &ldquo;facebook.com&rdquo; you will be taken directly to Facebook, but if you type in &ldquo;books of faces&rdquo; it will search for &ldquo;books of faces&rdquo; on your preferred search engine.</p>
<p>So, Kevin, try typing the URL for your email site into the address bar and hitting enter. Once you&rsquo;re there, don&rsquo;t forget that you can bookmark websites that you use frequently. Look for a star icon up at the top of your browser and click that. That will add your email to a list of favorite websites. Once you do that, you won&rsquo;t have to type anything &ndash; your email will always be just a click away.</p>

<html><body><p><script id="prx-p99634-embed" src="http://www.prx.org/p/99634/embed.js?size=small"></script></p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>I would like to start a blog. I have been gardening for quite a while, and I think it would be cool to share pictures and stories about my experiences, but I don&rsquo;t know how to go about starting one up. Can you help?</p>
<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>There are several great, free blogging tools that you can use to bring your gardening expertise to the masses. They all have similar features and are all pretty easy to setup. The hardest part is simply deciding which one will work for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2013/07/deemable_blog_logos.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright wp-image-8776 size-medium" src="/media/2013/07/deemable_blog_logos-300x240.png"  alt="deemable_blog_logos" width="300" height="240"></a>The three biggest blog creation tools are probably WordPress, Tumblr, and Blogger (aka Blogspot). All three of these let you post articles and pictures, customize the look and feel of your blog, and choose an easy-to-remember web address.</p>
<p>WordPress is one of the oldest blog systems, and is probably also the most popular. It has a ton of customization options for power users, although it can get kind of technical. You can create a basic blog for free to start out, and there are more advanced features that you can pay to get access to.</p>
<p>To get started with a WordPress blog, just go to&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a>&nbsp;and click the big orange &ldquo;Get Started&rdquo; button. All you need to get going is an email address, a password, and a name for your blog. The name you use will determine the URL for the blog &ndash; for example, if you named your blog &ldquo;KristinasGardenBlog&rdquo; the default WordPress web address would be &ldquo;KristinasGardenBlog.WordPress.com.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your second blogging choice is Tumblr. Tumblr is kind of the new hip kid on the blogging block. It feels a bit more like Twitter or Facebook in that you can follow people on it and you can repost things that other people on Tumblr have posted. You can also do regular blog posts just like on WordPress, and it&rsquo;s very easy to use.</p>
<p>To get started, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">tumblr.com</a>&nbsp;and click the &ldquo;Sign up&rdquo; button. The default address of your Tumblr blog will be &ldquo;your username.tumblr.com,&rdquo; so choose a username carefully.</p>
<p>Lastly there is Blogger, also known as Blogspot. Just go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.blogger.com/">blogger.com</a>&nbsp;and it will walk you through the process of setting everything up. Blogger is owned by Google so it will ask you to login with a Gmail address and it will associate your blog with that address. You will be asked to pick a blog address like &ldquo;KristinasGardenBlog.blogspot.com.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To get an idea of which blogging tool is right for you, try searching for other blogs that use that tool. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="http://blogsofnote.blogspot.com/">blogsofnote.blogspot.com</a>&nbsp;lists cool blogs that use Blogger. WordPress showcases interesting blogs made using their service on the site<a href="http://wordpress.org/showcase/">wordpress.org/showcase</a>. When you sign up for Tumblr it will suggest numerous blogs to you based on your interest.</p>
<p>Setting up a blog with these services is easy. Each of them will walk you through the process and have you blogging away within minutes! The hard part is really keeping up with regular blog posts. Remember, the most successful blogs are the ones that are updated frequently.</p>
<p>Good luck with your gardening blog, Kristina. We look forward to reading it!</p>

<p>RAY: Hi, I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister,</p>
<p>TOM: I&rsquo;m Tom Braun,</p>
<p>RAY: and we&rsquo;re the hosts of Deemable Tech. On the show, we answer your questions about computers, tablets, mobile phones and the Internet, like this question:</p>
<p>TOM: Marjory writes, Can you help me understand Facebook&rsquo;s privacy settings? I want to finally join the 21st century and sign up so I can see my son&rsquo;s baby pics and updates, but I don&rsquo;t want the whole world to see everything I write or upload.</p>
<p>RAY: Welcome to the 21st century, Marjory!</p>
<p>TOM: You&rsquo;re definitely right to be concerned. Facebook privacy settings can be hard to figure out. In fact you&rsquo;d be surprised how little even people who are heavy Facebook users know about Facebook privacy settings.</p>
<p>RAY: Tom, doesn&rsquo;t Facebook keep all your information private by default?</p>
<p>TOM: No, in fact they do the complete opposite, Ray. Facebook&rsquo;s default assumption is that you want to broadcast everything to the whole wide world. Posts and statuses marked with the little globe icon are visible to anyone with a Facebook account, which is pretty much&hellip; everyone. However, any time you post something on Facebook you can choose to make it friends-only, friends-of-friends, or a custom security setting.</p>
<p>RAY: What is a custom security setting?</p>
<p>TOM: You can actually make lists of friends and choose to share posts only with friends on that list. That way if you have a post that you think would be funny for your college buddies but not your grandmother, you can make sure that only the right people see it.</p>
<p>RAY: The first thing you&rsquo;ll want to do, Marjory, is check out the Facebook privacy settings menu. Up in the blue bar that runs across the top of the Facebook page you should see a little gear icon next to your name. That&rsquo;s the ?settings&rsquo; button. Click the button and a drop-down menu will appear. Then click the ?Privacy Settings&rsquo; option. This will take you to ?Privacy Settings and Tools&rsquo;.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a list of options that you can change. ?Who can see my future posts? allows you to set the default for posts to friends-only, for instance.</p>
<p>TOM: You can still set it back to ?Public&rsquo; any time you post something.</p>
<p>RAY: Right. You can also decide whether or not you want people to be able to search for you by email address or phone number, or whether search engines like Google can search for your profile.</p>
<p>TOM: Ray, if you say ?no&rsquo; to all this stuff, can people still search for your profile on Facebook?</p>
<p>RAY: Yes, they can. It used to be that you could hide your profile completely from anyone who wasn&rsquo;t your friend, but Facebook has recently made all profiles searchable. You can still make all the information IN your profile, including your profile pic, private though.</p>
<p>TOM: Be sure to visit the ?Timeline and Tagging&rsquo; menu while you&rsquo;re tweaking privacy settings. There&rsquo;s a link to it on the left-hand side of the privacy page.</p>
<p>This page allows you to manage tags.</p>
<p>RAY: A tag is when someone labels a picture with my name, right?</p>
<p>TOM: Right. When you start typing a friend&rsquo;s name and Facebook pops up their picture and you click it, that&rsquo;s a ?tag&rsquo;. When you tag someone in a post or on a picture it adds a link to their profile page and notifies that friend that they&rsquo;ve been ?tagged&rsquo;.</p>
<p>If you are tagged in another friend&rsquo;s post or picture, your friends will be able to view that picture or post by default, even if they&rsquo;re not friends with the person who tagged you.</p>
<p>The ?Timeline and Tagging&rsquo; page allows you to change this, and even to approve tags with your name before they appear on posts and pictures.</p>
<p>RAY: With a working knowledge of Facebook&rsquo;s privacy settings and how to control who sees your posts, you can spend a lot less time worrying about who sees what you wrote on Facebook and more time communicating with your friends!</p>

<p>TOM: If you have a question for Deemable Tech give us a call us at One Eight Eight Eight, Nine Seven Two, Nine Eight Six Eight, or you can send us an email at questions at deemable dot com.</p>
<p>RAY: For Deemable Tech, I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister&hellip;</p>
<p>TOM. And I&rsquo;m Tom Braun.</p>

<p>DRAFT TRANSCRIPT</p>
<p>RAY: From WJCT studios in Jacksonville, Florida, I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister,</p>

<p>RAY: This week, back in the studio once again, we have a special guest, Elizabeth Pampalone, owner of <a href="JaxComputerChic.com">JaxComputerChic.com</a>, a small business computer consulting and computer training company. Welcome back to the show Elizabeth!</p>
<p>ELIZABETH: *vamp response*</p>
<p>RAY: Today we are going to do something a little different. We have a backlog of older questions to get through.</p>
<p>TOM: Why didn&rsquo;t we answer those questions?</p>
<p>RAY: Laziness? Stupidity? A lack of organization?</p>
<p>TOM: Yeah, that sounds about right. So what are we going to do about them?</p>
<p>RAY: I thought we should just run through them, as fast as we can, answering them off the cuff, gameshow style. In fact, I thought we could call it.</p>
<p>*THE LIGHTNING ROUND*</p>
<p>TOM: Wow, what are we calling it again?</p>
<p>RAY: *THE LIGHTNING ROUND*</p>
<p>TOM: Awesome! But before we dive into The Lightning Round &ndash;</p>
<p>RAY: You mean, *THE LIGHTNING ROUND*</p>
<p>TOM: Yeah, that. Before we do that, we have a couple of ordinary questions to answer. And, Elizabeth, feel free to dive in on these at any point.</p>
<p>ELIZABETH: OK. Looks like the first question is from a guy named Ryan.</p>
<p>RAY: Cool, can you read it for us?</p>
<p>ELIZABETH: Ryan writes, For some reason, I can&rsquo;t find 1channel or icefilms as add on options on my XBMCHub on my Windows 7 laptop. They are amazing on the unlocked Apple TV, and I want to put them on my laptop. Any thoughts?<br>
TOM: *laughs*<br>
Now I know how listeners to our show must feel when we start going on and on about things they&rsquo;ve never heard about.<br>
Before I yell at those pesky kids to get off my lawn, does anybody know what a 1channel or an icefilm is? And what is an XBM-whatever and what does it have to do with unlocking an Apple TV? I didn&rsquo;t even know you could unlock an Apple TV.<br>
RAY: Well, in the Apple world we call it jailbreaking. And yes, you definitely can jailbreak your Apple TV. Just like Jailbreaking an iPhone or iPad, you are simply taking off or breaking the code that keeps iOS shackled.<br>
TOM: Why would you want to?<br>
RAY: Well, normally your Apple TV can do two things: mirror the desktop of your Mac, iPhone or iPad, and stream media from iTunes, Hulu, Netflix, YouTube or one of the other authorized Apple TV channels, to your television. If you want to play any other kind of media through it, you&rsquo;re out of luck. But an Apple TV is actually a powerful little LINUX-based computer in its own right, and by losing it from its shackles, you can use it to stream just about anything you want to your television.<br>
TOM: OK, what is XB-whatever?<br>
RAY: XBMC. It used to stand for Xbox Media Center because that&rsquo;s what it started out as, but now it is a free, open source media player which can be run on a variety of devices.<br>
TOM: Including, let me guess, a jailbroken Apple TV or a Windows 7 laptop.<br>
RAY: You got it. The XBMC platform support third-party add-ons which allow you to do things like stream movies through it and watch ripped DVDs.<br>
TOM: So if I jailbreak my Apple TV, I can install XBMC and watch my ripped DVDs on it?<br>
RAY: Yep.<br>
TOM: Cool. But Ryan didn&rsquo;t just say XBMC, did he? He said XBMCHub.<br>
RAY: OK, so despite the fact that it was originally designed to be installed on hacked XBoxes and jailbroken Apple TV&rsquo;s, XBMC is supposed to only access legal content. But since it&rsquo;s open source, someone has created a separate version called XBMC Hub which is a little more &ndash; open &ndash; about what content you access through it.<br>
TOM: I&rsquo;m guessing 1channel and icefilms are ways to get free content that you&rsquo;d normally have to pay for.<br>
RAY: Well basically they are free services that host links to all kinds of TV and movies&hellip; some of which you should technically be paying for. But they don&rsquo;t actually host the content themselves, so they&rsquo;re in a legal grey area. There&rsquo;s no law that specifically says what they are doing is illegal, but that&rsquo;s never stopped a copyright lawyer before.<br>
TOM: Riiight. So, just to recap, Ryan has jailbroken his Apple TV and installed XBMC Hub on it so he can stream free TV shows and movies to his TV. And now he wants to do the same thing on his Windows laptop, but he&rsquo;s running into problems.<br>
RAY: I think that sums up it up.<br>
TOM: And&hellip; we&rsquo;re not going to help him, are we?<br>
RAY: No.<br>
TOM: Here&rsquo;s the deal Ryan, and all our other podcast listeners. Here at Deemable Tech we have a policy of trying to stay neutral on the topic of copyright, piracy, DRM and that sort of thing.<br>
On the one hand, it&rsquo;s your laptop, it&rsquo;s your Apple TV, you are welcome to try and do whatever you want with it. And we&rsquo;re not going to pretend that there aren&rsquo;t lots of ways to get, say, pretty much any movie or television program for free and stream it to your television.<br>
RAY: But we&rsquo;re also not going to tell you how to do it. At least in the US, distributing copyrighted content for free without the author&rsquo;s permission is technically illegal. Do people do it all the time? Yes. Should the laws about this stuff be different? Maybe. Are movie and TV studios technological dinosaurs with their heads stuck in the sand? Probably. But right now the law is the law and we can&rsquo;t be in the position of encouraging our listeners to break it.<br>
TOM: If you decide to stick it to the man and circumvent the official channels for this kind of stuff, well, that&rsquo;s your business. I mean, we&rsquo;re geeks, we get it. It&rsquo;s like rooting or jailbreaking your smartphone &ndash; it&rsquo;s your device, we think you should be able to do what you want with it. Fortunately, rooting and jailbreaking smartphones is legal. We&rsquo;re glad to answer questions about that on this podcast. But with other devices you&rsquo;re getting into a gray area and we can&rsquo;t help you. And as far as copyrighted content goes, well, we&rsquo;re not even going to touch that issue with a ten foot pole.<br>
Ryan, I&rsquo;m sure with a little technical know-how, Google-fu and maybe asking some questions on the right messageboards you can get your questions answered. But it&rsquo;s up to you to face the legal or technical consequences. So you&rsquo;re on your own with this one!</p>
<p>TOM: Fabio writes &ndash; Hi Tom and Ray,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Fabio and I&rsquo;m writing you from Italy. I&rsquo;m Italian so please forgive me if I make any mistakes. Here&rsquo;s my problem: I have a desktop computer with windows 7 and sometimes while I surf the web, (I use the latest version of firefox) the screen freezes for a couple of seconds and then on the system tray this message appears: ?Display driver stopped responding and has recovered?. I tried to update the video card driver (I have an ATI Radeon 5700) but the problem continues. I hope you can help me with this because it is really annoying. I really love your show, it&rsquo;s useful and entertaining and I&rsquo;ve downloaded every podcast of the program on Itunes.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>
<p>RAY: Awesome! Thanks for your question Fabio. That&rsquo;s a hard one. *PAUSE* Did you ever watch Eureka, Tom?</p>
<p>TOM: Like, one time. For five minutes. And then I changed the channel.</p>
<p>RAY: *Explain what Eureka is.*</p>
<p>TOM: OK, did you just completely change the subject? Aren&rsquo;t we going to answer Fabio&rsquo;s question?</p>
<p>RAY: Of course we are&hellip;</p>
<p>TOM: So what does this have to do with Fabio&rsquo;s question?</p>
<p>RAY: Explain how every episode of Eureka works.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the formula for a perfect Eureka episode:<br>
They&rsquo;re having a normal day, *example*<br>
then something wacky happens, *example*<br>
Then, they find out that that wacky thing has gotten worse, *example*<br>
Then they find out that the wacky thing was caused by some experiment, except the experiment wasn&rsquo;t suppose to work like that, *example*<br>
Then, they find out that the wacky thing happened because the first experiment interacted with a second experiment *example* and the interference of the two experiments caused the wacky thing.<br>
Then, they find out the wacky thing is going to (A) kill someone, (B) destroy the entire town, (C) kill everyone in the country, or (D) destroy the entire world, and they only have five minutes or less to fix it.<br>
So, then they come up with some ridiculously complicated method of changing the wacky thing described with technobabble by the geeks, and the sheriff describes it with an simple analogy, and it will probably result in an amazing new achievement in science if it works.<br>
And then, they do it. It almost always works, unless it&rsquo;s a ?very special episode? in which case the worst case scenario does happen, but even then there is a twist that makes it a good thing that it happened. *example*</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how it works. And Colin Ferguson, if you&rsquo;re listening, when you guys decide to make the Eureka movie, I am totally ready to write the script.</p>
<p>TOM: OK, Ray, while that was *vamps*, what does that have to do with Fabio&rsquo;s question?</p>
<p>RAY: I don&rsquo;t know? What was Fabio&rsquo;s question?</p>
<p>TOM: Remember, his display driver stopped responding? I knew it, you were just changing the subject!</p>
<p>RAY: *Explain how PCs are like Eureka. Everything should work together well, but they sometimes don&rsquo;t and it&rsquo;s really complicated to explain why.</p>
<p>TOM: Anyway, this one&rsquo;s pretty easy, you just</p>
<p>Open Catalyst Control Center and switch to ATI Overdrive<br>
Unlock and enable Overdrive<br>
Go to Options/Profiles/Profile Manager and create a new profile called, let&rsquo;s say, STABLE.<br>
Save the new profile. But DO NOT ACTIVATE the profile.<br>
Now go to C:\Users\{YourUserName}\AppData\Local\ATI\ACE\Profiles folder ( I assume C: is your system drive )<br>
Note: You should have &rdquo; show hidden files &rdquo; turned on to see the folder.<br>
Open the .xml file named STABLE with notepad.<br>
Change the values of the idle Core clock and Memory clock speeds below</p>
<p>Feature name=&rdquo;CoreClockTarget_0&Prime;<br>
Property name=&rdquo;Want_0&Prime; value=&rdquo;40000&Prime; note: previous value should be &ldquo;15700&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feature name=&rdquo;MemoryClockTarget_0&Prime;<br>
Property name=&rdquo;Want_0&Prime; value=&rdquo;90000&Prime; note: previous value should be &ldquo;30000&rdquo;<br>
Save the file and close it.<br>
Go back to CCC and activate the profile. This will make the card idle at 400 MHz core clock and 900 MHz memory clock.</p>
<p>Boom! You&rsquo;re good. Hopefully.</p>
<p>RAY: So&hellip; Yeah there is a possible solution, but it is very complicated and no one else in the world will get any benefit out of it. So, Fabio we are going to send you an email with a link to the information. So you can try it out for yourself, and let us know how it works out.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/276896-33-radeon-5750-display-driver-stopped-responding">http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/276896-33-radeon-5750-display-driver-stopped-responding</a></p>
<p>RAY: OKay guys, we&rsquo;ve gotten through the regular questions, so do you know what time it is?</p>
<p>TOM: I think it&rsquo;s time for *THE LIGHTNING ROUND*</p>
<p>RAY: Yes!</p>
<p>ELIZABETH: So how&rsquo;s it going to work?</p>
<p>RAY: *explains*</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>
<p>Anonymous &ndash; I LOVE my Windows Phone. I just don&rsquo;t know why the business world doesn&rsquo;t use them more often. The OS is better than the ?cutesy? Android system that seems more teenager/unprofessional like. It has Office (word, PowerPoint, Excel), and more over Outlook ?.everything we may use in the business world. I just don&rsquo;t know why I can&rsquo;t sync my Outlook calendar at the office with my Samsung Smartphone Windows OS? I have an &ldquo;Microsoft Exchange server&rdquo; &ndash; the Phone asks for this but it always asks for a &ldquo;domain name&rdquo;? What are these and what do I type into make this work?</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Hey guys,</p>
<p dir="ltr">I have my laptop hooked up to my LCD tv via HDMI so that I can watch &nbsp;Netflix. However, recently I have noticed that if I&rsquo;m watching a show that&rsquo;s longer than 30 minutes the audio and video will suddenly stop being sent to the tv via HDMI, and instead it starts playing directly from the laptop, almost as if the HDMI itself went into sleep mode. If I move the mouse, then the HDMI audio and video goes back to the tv.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What gives?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, after trying to hook my laptop up to my tv via the VGA connection,&nbsp;now it doesn&rsquo;t recognize my tv as an LCD, but thinks its an analog CRT and won&rsquo;t allow me to set the proper resolution!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Arrrrrrrgh!</p>
<p>-Joel</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong></p>
<p>Melody &ndash; I recently heard a piece where you all recommended the Find My iPhone app and was wondering about something. I keep my Location Services off unless I need them, since they seem to be a huge battery suck. Will the Find My iPhone features still work if the Location Services are off?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Question 4:</b></p>
<p>Voicemail transcript: Dan this jacksonville beach florida&hellip; I&rsquo;m calling to see if you do house calls &hellip; and if you do &hellip; please call me back and let me know otherwise I guess I maybe have to call &hellip; I&rsquo;m making some call again but thank you very much I appreciate hearing from you and enjoy your programs on &hellip; on the radio thank you bye bye.</p>
<p><b>Question 5:</b></p>
<p>Scott &ndash; Dear Ray &amp; Tom,<br>
I have windows internet explorer version 8 and everytime I bring it up, it gives me the error message, ?A program on your computer has corrupted your browser preferences? and then I have click on ?OK? or change my preferences. I can&rsquo;t seem to get rid of it. I have re-enabled Google as my default browser and I still get the error message. I tried picking another browser and I still get the error message.<br>
Is there any way I can stop the error message?<br>
Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Question 6:</b></p>
<p>Jennifer writes, I listened to your show this morning on WJCT about protecting the iPad &amp; iPhone. I have the Blackberry Bold 9900 &amp; Blackberry Playbook 64gb tablet. I would like a recommendation for apps to protect, lock down &amp; secure the Blackberry Bold &amp; Blackberry Playbook tablet.<br>
Thanks for all your help!</p>
<p><b>Question 7:</b></p>
<p>Alan &ndash; Hi Ray/Tom,<br>
My iphone sends my incoming mail to the trash. The messages appear briefly in the in box, then go to trash. ATT says it is a problem with my computer settings, Apple says it is a problem with Yahoo. I have cleared and reset the account information to no avail.</p>
<p>I went online and spoke with some guy in India who said he could fix it for $50.00. I was irritated and did not take him up on it. I would rather pay you or someone local.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p><b>Question 8:</b></p>
<p>Mel &ndash; Hi I am using an HP laptop with Vista. My account is with AT&amp;T (bellsouth.net) for my email. Yahoo is only my choice as my search engine. I would like to use Google as a choice. How can I do that with out messing up my email?</p>
<p>Love your spot on NPR&rsquo;s morning edition.</p>
<p><b>Question 9:</b></p>
<p>Michelle &ndash; I have an LG Thrill from AT&amp;T that has been unlocked. I&rsquo;m using it on T-Mobile, but I can&rsquo;t get the data to work on it. What do I need to do to get the data working?</p>

<html><body><p>Heidi wants to know what this Kickstarter thing she keeps hearing about on Facebook is. Why are people asking her for money? Ray Hollister and Tom Braun, the hosts of Deemable Tech, have the answer on this week&rsquo;s Ask Deemable Tech.</p>
<p><script id="prx-p94563-embed" src="http://www.prx.org/p/94563/embed.js?size=full"></script></p>
<p>RAY: Hi, I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister&hellip;</p>
<p>TOM: I&rsquo;m Tom Braun&hellip;</p>
<p>RAY: and we&rsquo;re the hosts of Deemable Tech. On the show, we answer your questions about computers, tablets, mobile phones and the Internet, like this question:</p>
<p>Heidi asks: What is a Kickstarter? I see people posting on Facebook and Twitter about it. Why are people asking for money? Is it safe to do? How do I know it&rsquo;s not a scam?</p>
<p>RAY: Great question, Heidi. Kickstarter has really taken off in the past year or so. It is a website that allows you to essentially ?pitch&rsquo; your product, creative idea or project to the internet. It&rsquo;s pretty simple: you set up a Kickstarter project, pick a funding goal, and then anyone on the Internet can support you.</p>
<p>TOM: Yeah. While initially people were using Kickstarter to fund smaller projects, it really has gone mainstream. Now bands have funded albums through Kickstarter, developers have funded video games and just recently the creator of the Veronica Mars TV show Kickstarted a Veronica Mars movie, to star Kristen Bell.</p>
<p>RAY: Some public radio shows have used Kickstarter to fund their projects including Jacksonville&rsquo;s own &ldquo;State of the Re:Union.&rdquo; We even recently funded an app for Deemable Tech through a Kickstarter project. We raised over $1,000 to cover the costs of building a mobile app for iPhone and Android. Once we have that finished, we&rsquo;ll let you know.</p>
<p>TOM: Now, are there risks to Kickstarter? Well one of the great aspects to Kickstarter is that unless a project gets fully funded they don&rsquo;t actually charge you. It&rsquo;s just a pledge.</p>
<p>The payment system also goes through Amazon Payments here in the US, so it&rsquo;s very secure.</p>
<p>RAY: Now, there&rsquo;s still no way to guarantee that the project you are supporting itself isn&rsquo;t a scam. Kickstarter does do some vetting of the projects that people submit, but it&rsquo;s not impossible.</p>
<p>TOM: Very rare, but not impossible.</p>
<p>RAY: And something to keep in mind is that you are not investing in the company, and you are not buying a product. You are giving your money to the project for them to use. In most cases, you get some reward, which is often the product they are trying to create, but if something happens and they aren&rsquo;t able to produce that product, there&rsquo;s not much you can do about it.</p>
<p>Of course if you know the people involved in the project or if it&rsquo;s being put on by a reputable source then you can be fairly confident that your money will be well-spent.</p>
<p>TOM: Overall I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s reasonably secure. Kickstarter is a legitimate organization and they are working hard to make sure that people&rsquo;s money goes where it&rsquo;s supposed to go.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s awesome, because it gives people a chance to back things they are genuinely enthusiastic about.</p>
<p>Now Ray, how exactly does it work? How do I support a project on Kickstarter?</p>
<p>RAY: Go to kickstarter.com, and search for the project you are interested in. Click on the project, on the project page you will see a video or note from the project&rsquo;s creator telling you what it&rsquo;s all about. On the right-hand side of the page is a big green button that says &ldquo;Back this Project.&rdquo; Click that button and you will be taken to a page asking how much you want to pledge, and what you want your reward to be. After that you will be taken through the steps of the payment process.</p>
<p>TOM: So Kickstarter sounds like it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward, safe, and a great way to support things you love.</p>
<p>RAY: Absolutely! It allows folks to start projects that they wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be able to do. Instead of having to find one rich angel investor to back your project, you can ask all of your friends and family for $5 bucks.</p>
<p>RAY: To hear more answers to questions like this one, listen to our show at Deemable dot com, that&rsquo;s D-E E-M A-B-L-E dot com. There you can listen to all of our previous episodes and, subscribe to our podcast.</p>

<p>Support for Deemable Tech is provided by&nbsp;<a href="http://asmallorange.com/">A Small Orange</a>, Homegrown Hosting. A refreshingly different approach to web hosting. On the web at&nbsp;<a href="http://asmallorange.com/">asmallorange.com</a>.</p>
<p>RAY: From WJCT studios in Jacksonville, Florida, I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister,</p>
<p>TOM: I&rsquo;m Tom Braun,</p>
<p>RAY: and this is Deemable Tech, technology worth talking about, and tech help worth listening to.</p>
<p>TOM: Got a question about your computer, smart phone, tablet or the Internet? Give us a call us at One Eight Eight Eight, Nine Seven Two, Nine Eight Six Eight, or send us an email at questions@deemable.com.</p>
<p>TOM: Today on the show, we&rsquo;ll be talking about jailbreaking iPhones, and whether it&rsquo;s illegal to unlock your smartphone, and</p>
<p>RAY: Blackberry 10 and whether you can get apps for your Pantech Renue, and</p>
<p>TOM: sharing music with Dropbox.</p>
<p>RAY: But first&hellip;</p>
<p>There were Two big tech news items this week. First of all, Samsung revealed the next phone in its line of Galaxy S flagship phones, the S4. Features include a larger screen with a 1080&times;1920, a 13 megapixel camera, eye-based scrolling and the ability to use it with gloves.</p>
<p>Tom, you&rsquo;ve got a GS3. Are you thinking of making the switch?</p>
<p>TOM: To be honest Ray, I think I feel like you do about switching to the iPhone 5 when you have a 4s.</p>
<p>I think if you don&rsquo;t have a Galaxy S3 or you have an older Galaxy, by all means you should wait a month and pick up the S4 when it comes out. But it&rsquo;s not a quantum leap forward over the S3, and personally my S3 is still working really well for me. In fact I would say it&rsquo;s continuing to get better. So I&rsquo;m not going to rush out and upgrade just yet.</p>
<p>So what was the other big news?</p>
<p>RAY: Well Google has announced that as part of their annual ?spring cleaning&rsquo; they will be shutting down Google Reader.</p>
<p>TOM: Noooooooooooooo!!!!!!!</p>
<p>&ndash; was my reaction upon hearing that news earlier this week.</p>
<p>RAY:</p>
<p>Since Google announced that it was closing Reader, its news aggregator service, we&rsquo;ve received several questions ranging from ?How do I live without it?? to ?What the heck is it, and why is everyone freaking out??</p>
<p>For folks in the latter category, Google Reader is the equivalent of a friendly butler that finds all of the news that you are interested in reading from the news sources and blogs you trust. Instead of having to open 10 different websites every day, you could open just one page whenever you wanted. It automatically gathered all of the stories that have been published by the ten websites you follow since the last time you opened the page.</p>
<p>Now you are probably just as upset that it is closing as everyone else, let me tell you the good news. There is hope. Other companies are stepping up to fill in the gap that Google Reader is leaving behind. Some of them work exactly the same as Google Reader does; others take what Google Reader does and improves upon it.</p>
<p>Google Reader Alternatives:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://theoldreader.com/">The Old Reader</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.newsblur.com/">NewsBlur</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.netvibes.com/en">NetVibe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pulse.me/">Pulse</a></li>
</ul><p>We&rsquo;ll have a full break down of the available Google Reader Alternatives later this week. What are you using or planning on using to replace Google Reader?</p>
<p><strong>Hey, I&rsquo;ve been listening to your show, but I don&rsquo;t often have a whole hour to pay attention to the computer at one point in the day. Also, sometimes I don&rsquo;t have a huge interest in a particular topic (horrors!), but later decide I really want to know about something you spoke about in a past show. Anyway, would it be possible to put &ldquo;sections&rdquo; in the show notes? Sort of using the little music breaks as dividers, and saying, &ldquo;In section 1, we cover these topics. Section 2, which starts at minute marker 20, discusses those; and Section 3, at minute 40, includes the others.&rdquo; Then I could easily come back to the section where I had to quit listening, or quickly find a particular subject I&rsquo;m listening to.</strong><br><strong> Perhaps there&rsquo;s another way I could find that info, but my tech savvy mostly comes from pushing buttons and Googling answers to my questions, and I&rsquo;ve not really done either of those with podcasts.</strong><br><strong> Anyway, thanks for the show!</strong><br><strong> &ndash;Breana in Jax</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for your email, Breana. Well, we agree. Actually, that is something that we really want to improve about our website. A few of our older episodes do have that. We had the question and when the question started in the show. The problem is time. A lot of folks think we get paid to do this, which is a great compliment, thank you! But actually, we are all volunteers. Tom and I work elsewhere 40 hours a week. Sean does work here at the station, but he doesn&rsquo;t get paid to do this. So, Deemable Tech takes about 30 hours a week combined to produce each episode of the show. Doing the show notes like that took about 2-3 extra hours each week, because you have to go through and listen to the entire episode again, write down when each question started, and then rephrase the question so that it&rsquo;s a sentence instead of a paragraph. So, it&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;seem like a lot, but it actually ends up being a little bit of work, and I haven&rsquo;t been able to do that since I started writing the blogs for Folio Weekly.</p>
<p>Now, we have found out that it helps radio stations when they are considering to air our show if we can provide a transcript of each show. That would be even more work, because some of what we say is scripted, but a lot of it isn&rsquo;t, but I think that would be helpful to some of our listeners too. So again, we really want to produce better show notes, but we are limited in what we can do because of our budget constraints. You know, not having one.</p>
<p>Now, if we had a volunteer that wanted to help us, we might be able to bring that back! What we would need would be someone to come to the studio with us when we record or listen live online, and keep track of when we start new questions, and then take those notes and put them together with the show notes. Also, we&rsquo;re looking for a volunteer to help us out with video.&nbsp;If you or someone you know would be willing to help us out, send me an email at rayhollister@deemable.com.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My coworker has a jailbroken iPhone, and she keeps trying to convince me that I should let her jailbreak my iPhone too. My iPhone 4S is out of warranty now, but I&rsquo;m still afraid of breaking it. I can&rsquo;t afford to replace it right now. Not that I don&rsquo;t trust her, but if I do it, I&rsquo;d like to do it myself. Is it hard to do? Is it worth jailbreaking? Is there any chance I can get in trouble? What happens if something screws up, and my iPhone doesn&rsquo;t work anymore?</strong></p>
<p>A: I don&rsquo;t blame you for being cautious. I had never tried jailbreaking an iPhone either until I received your email. I&rsquo;ve always been a little scared to attempt to jailbreak my iPhone because I was worried it might break, too. But, I screwed up my courage and decided to give it a shot.</p>
<p>Is it hard to do? Not really. It used to be much harder. The first jailbreak required disassembling the iPhone! On iOS 6.0 through 6.1.2, as long as you have the most basic understanding of how to use your computer, you shouldn&rsquo;t have a hard time jailbreaking your iPhone. In fact, I can assume that if you are considering doing it, you probably have the skills required to do it.</p>
<p>Is it worth it? Well, that all depends on what you want out of your phone. If you are content with how your phone works, and you don&rsquo;t want to take any risks what-so-ever, then it&rsquo;s probably not worth it to you. However, if you&rsquo;d like to try use apps that aren&rsquo;t allowed in the App Store, or you would like to customize your iPhone to work the way you want it to, or if you just like to tinker, you&rsquo;ll probably enjoy jailbreaking your iPhone.<br>
There are fantastic customizations like alternative keyboards and themes. There are tons of great apps that you can&rsquo;t get in the app store, not because they have porn or have viruses, but because they work in a way that Apple won&rsquo;t allow. An example is an app called iCaughtU that takes a picture whenever someone tries to enter your passcode into your phone and fails. Because the app uses the camera in a way that Apple didn&rsquo;t design, they&rsquo;ll never allow that app to be sold in the App Store.</p>
<p>Ironically, if you want to see what will likely be in the next version of iOS, check Cydia, the app store you get when you have a jailbroken iPhone. You know how you can take a picture by pressing the volume button? Jailbreakers had that first. You know how you can double tap the home button to open another app that you were just running? Jailbreakers had that first. You know how you can change your wallpaper? Jailbreakers, well you get the point. Many of the &ldquo;new&rdquo; features in each version of iOS are features that jailbreakers have already had for months or years.</p>
<p>Is there a chance you&rsquo;ll get in trouble? Yes, of course, it could happen, but no, probably not, at least not with the law. The Library of Congress has said that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/10/jailbreaking-now-legal-under-dmca-for-smartphones-but-not-tablets/">it is legal to jailbreak a smart phone</a>. Strangely, the same is not true about an iPad. It has to do with the vague definition of a tablet device. However, the lawyers for the movie, television and music industry are fighting to try to change that. When it comes to the law, especially copyright law, which is what impacts this the most, what is true today could be false tomorrow. Also, you could get in trouble with Apple. As of yet, Apple has never tried to take legal action against jailbreakers, but even though you aren&rsquo;t breaking the law, you are breaking the terms of service that you agreed to when you set up your device. Obviously, if you do &ldquo;brick&rdquo; your iPhone (damage it beyond the point of repair) while jailbreaking your iPhone don&rsquo;t even think about taking your iPhone to the folks at the Genius Bar.</p>
<p>What happens if you screw up your phone? Well, fortunately, that isn&rsquo;t as great a risk as it used to be. If it does happen, you can usually just restore your iPhone back to its factory default settings. Don&rsquo;t get too excited. You could still brick your phone. But it is much safer than it was a few years ago. Jailbreaking is dangerous. It&rsquo;s risky. You are intentionally making something work in a way it was not intended to by the company that created it. So, in doing that, you take on all the possible risk and benefits on yourself. You&rsquo;re on your own, but you&rsquo;re not really alone because there is a whole community of jailbreakers out there that are willing to help you.<br>
So, ultimately, I can&rsquo;t tell you if it&rsquo;s worth it. It&rsquo;s up to you. If you want to do it, and you&rsquo;re willing to take the risk, give it a shot. Check out guide on how to <a href="http://deemable.com/how-to-jailbreak-your-iphone">jailbreak your iPhone</a> on Deemable.com.</p>
<p><strong>Robert writes: I&rsquo;ve heard that it is now illegal to unlock your cellphone. Is that really true?!?</strong><br>
TOM: That&rsquo;s correct Robert. The Library of Congress decided that starting January 26th, unlocking your cell phone would no longer be legal.</p>
<p>RAY: Now, to be clear, that&rsquo;s unlocking your cell phone. Not rooting or jail-breaking it, right?</p>
<p>TOM: Right Ray, or the Feds would be hauling you off to jail right now.<br>
Unlocking your cell phone is when you buy a phone on one carrier, say, AT&amp;T and then you want to switch to another carrier, say, Sprint, and take your phone with you. Ordinarily the phone is ?locked&rsquo; to the original carrier. Unlocking your phone allows you to use it on a different network.</p>
<p>RAY: There&rsquo;s a few different ways to do this. Before locking became illegal (again) you could even pay some services to do an ?official&rsquo; unlock for you, at least for iPhones.</p>
<p>TOM: Right. They would just add your phone&rsquo;s unique IMEI number to the database of unlocked phones and you were set.&nbsp;Now, obviously, that is no longer an option for US customers. So you would have to get a different sim card or download some software (yes Virginia, there is an app for that). But if you did so, according to the Library of Congress, you would now be breakin&rsquo; the law.</p>
<p>RAY: Wait, what does the Library of Congress have to do with this? Since when did they make rules about cell phones?</p>
<p>TOM: Since the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, or the DMCA, gave them the power. The DMCA makes bypassing digital protections of copyrighted works illegal, but gives the Library of Congress the power to designate exceptions. Up until recently, the Library of Congress had said that unlocking your cell phone was one of those exceptions. Now, it seems, they&rsquo;ve changed their mind.&nbsp;Now, not everybody is okay with this. In fact, President Obama has released a public statement saying that he would like the Library of Congress to change its mind and the FCC is investigating whether they have any say in the matter.&nbsp;At the moment though, it looks like the law is on the Library of Congress&rsquo;s side. We don&rsquo;t elect Library of Congress members, but we do elect lawmakers! If you want to make your voice heard, download Congress+ for the iPhone or Contact Congress in the Play Market for Android. These apps will tell you who your local senator or congressperson are and give you ways to contact them. Ask Congress to change the DMCA to give consumers the freedom to choose which carrier they use their phone on. Make your voice heard. Set our cell phones free!</p>
<p>RAY: That was really inspiring Tom.</p>
<p>TOM: I may just be a tech podcaster, Ray, but I&rsquo;m a patriotic tech podcaster.</p>
<p>RAY: Sho&rsquo;nuff!</p>
<p>RAY: Who&rsquo;s this next question from?</p>
<p>TOM: Your mom.</p>
<p>RAY: Tom, let&rsquo;s keep it professional.</p>
<p>TOM: No really, your mom sent us a question. <strong>She asks: Has version 10 been released yet? Is it a smart move to continue with Blackberry as our phone?</strong></p>
<p>Mom, you don&rsquo;t listen to the show regularly, do you? It&rsquo;s OK, I understand. We just pick on Blackberry a lot. So, yes, BlackBerry 10 has been released. It came out on January 30.??? But, it doesn&rsquo;t matter because you&rsquo;re not getting it, unless you decide to buy a new phone. BlackBerry 10 only runs on the new device the Q10 and the Z10. The change from BlackBerry OS to BlackBerry 10 was so drastic that none of the previous devices support it. Also, none of the apps you have on your current phone are going to work on a new BlackBerry 10 device if you decide to get one. So, no matter what new phone you get, even if it&rsquo;s a new BlackBerry, you&rsquo;ll have to buy new apps.</p>
<p>Now, to tell you the truth, Blackberry OS looks pretty decent. In fact, it looks a lot like webOS. Honestly, It reminds me a lot of webOS. BlackBerry seems to be repeating exactly what Palm did in 2009: They were hurting really bad, They were losing money like crazy, Their competitors were chewing up their market share, and their operating system looked old and decrepit. So, they rebuilt their operating system from the ground up, and relaunched it, they took a really long time to bring it to market, and they completely abandoned all of their old customers.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, I would say no, it&rsquo;s not a smart move to continue with BlackBerry. I expect that BlackBerry is going to take a path very similar to the one that Palm took. I expect that the Q10 and the Z10 are probably going to sell fairly poorly. BlackBerry will probably attempt to put out another version of the Q10 in the Z10, but that will also sell fairly poorly. BlackBerry will attempt to get other manufacturers to use their operating system, but they won&rsquo;t be able to get anyone interested. Finally, they&rsquo;ll end up selling out to another company, filing bankruptcy, and or releasing BlackBerry 10 as open source. No matter how you slice it, I don&rsquo;t see good things in BlackBerry&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>The smartphone industry, as much as Microsoft and Blackberry fanboys would love it to be a different way, is a two dog race. It&rsquo;s all between iPhone and Android. Android has even taken up such a huge market share because they have hundreds of different devices out there running Android, that even the iPhone is starting to drop back in terms of overall market share.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t think there is room in the market for another operating system to be a real competitor. Microsoft Phone has it&rsquo;s flaws that we talked about on the show. Personally I felt that webOS is the perfect operating system, but neither of them have been able to get anywhere near a decent market share to the point where they would be really competitive.</p>
<p>So, Mom, what I would tell you do to is if you&rsquo;re looking to get something new right now, get the iPhone 4 for free from Sprint, or if you&rsquo;re still under contract, wait until the iPhone 5S or 6 comes out, and get the iPhone 4S for free.</p>
<p><strong>Linda writes: My friend installed DropBox on my computer and setup a shared folder so we could share music (we both love European dance music). Confession: he&rsquo;s sent me so much stuff and I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to look at it. Now I want to, and I don&rsquo;t know how!</strong><br><strong> My question is two part: 1) how do I download music from our shared folder in Dropbox (is it through the website?) and 2) can he tell that I haven&rsquo;t listened to any of the music yet?</strong><br><strong> Oh and also, once before he helped me fix something on my computer by taking it over remotely. Can he still do that?</strong><br><strong> I have Windows 7. Thanks!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>TOM: Good question, Linda.</p>
<p>Now you can download any file you have access to on the Dropbox website by right-clicking it and selecting ?download&rsquo;. Make sure to put the file some place where you can find it!<br>
However, if your friend installed Dropbox on your computer, you don&rsquo;t need to download the files: they&rsquo;re already on your computer. That&rsquo;s the whole point of Dropbox!<br>
So first we need to make sure that Dropbox really is installed on your computer. The simple way to do that is to click on the Start menu, then type ?dropbox&rsquo; (your typing should appear down in the search box at the bottom). After a few seconds the Dropbox program should come up. It&rsquo;s got an icon that looks like an open blue box. If you see it, you have it.<br>
Now, step two is to determine where the Dropbox folders are located on your computer. Dropbox installs a shortcut to its folders under your ?favorites&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s not your internet explorer favorites, that&rsquo;s your windows explorer favorites. Go back to the Start menu and click on ?Computer&rsquo;. That will open a Windows Explorer folder. The bar on the left side has a bunch of folders like ?Pictures&rsquo;, ?Documents&rsquo;, and ?Music&rsquo;. Up at the very top (you may have to scroll up) there should be a section called ?Favorites&rsquo;. It should contain your ?Desktop&rsquo; folder, as well as the ?Dropbox&rsquo; folder. If you see Dropbox there, click it.<br>
Now you&rsquo;re in the Dropbox folders. You&rsquo;ll have to find the music files your friend has shared with you from here, since I don&rsquo;t know where he put them! You can either click around through the folders here, or search for a song you know he&rsquo;s sent you in the ?Search dropbox&rsquo; box at the top right of the window.<br>
Now, every file in the Dropbox folder should have a green check mark on it. That means you&rsquo;ve downloaded it from Dropbox&rsquo;s cloud. If it has a blue icon, it&rsquo;s still uploading or downloading, so you&rsquo;ll have to wait before using it. The icons tell you that you are sharing that file with the Dropbox cloud. There&rsquo;s a copy on your computer, and a copy out there on Dropbox&rsquo;s servers.<br>
What the icons, don&rsquo;t tell you is whether or not you&rsquo;ve ever used, opened, looked at or listened to these files. All you know is that you have them. And that&rsquo;s all your friend knows either, Linda. So I don&rsquo;t think he has any way to find out that you haven&rsquo;t listened to his music unless you give it away yourself.</p>
<p>RAY: Ok, but Linda says her friend accessed her computer remotely once. How does she know he can&rsquo;t do it again?</p>
<p>TOM: Well most likely the last time he accessed her computer he used Windows Remote Assistance. This is a program that allows you to send an invitation to someone else to share your desktop so that they can help you with a problem.</p>
<p>Linda, Windows Remote Assistance is by invitation only. Unless you run the program and intentionally SEND your friend an invitation, he can&rsquo;t login.<br>
So your secret is safe with us!</p>
<p>Oh by the way, Linda, if you want to have fun with your friend, remember that shared folders in Dropbox go both ways. You can add files to them as well! Why don&rsquo;t you drop a little text file in there that says ?Enjoying the music you sent!? See how long it takes for your friend to notice it&rsquo;s there.</p>
<p><strong>Jo el asks: Dear Deemable Tech. I have a question that I am pining for your expert opinion about. What is the BEST calendar app for a Pantech Renue? I tried Googling it, but nothing really comes up. I am app ignorant</strong></p>
<p>RAY: Don&rsquo;t worry. Finding any information on the web about the Pantech Renue is difficult. The Pantech Renue runs on Pantech&rsquo;s proprietary operating system, which is based on an operating system called BREW. It should run most J2ME apps, which is Java Micro Edition. Java Micro Edition was designed so that developers could build programs for mobile phones. It was supposed to make it so that a developer could make one program that would work anywhere. Unfortunately, that is not how it actually worked, because usually you were be forced to only buy apps through your carrier. Before the iPhone came out, everything in mobile was made for either J2ME or Palm OS. Once the iPhone hit the market, and the Android became a legitimate option, most developers stopped building apps for J2ME. Unfortunately, there&nbsp;aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;many apps available for J2ME anymore.</p>
<p>So, the best calendar app is going to be anything you can find. You can try<a href="http://www.jappit.com/blog/gcal-the-j2me-google-calendar-client/"> GCal</a> which is a J2ME Google Calendar client. If that&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;work, you might be able to use<a href="http://wappy.to/gcalsync"> GCalSync which</a> will sync the built-in calendar with your Google Calendar, assuming you use Google Calendar. Both of these apps use data, so if you do not have a data plan, you may want to stay away from them.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, I wouldn&rsquo;t pay for anything in their store. You won&rsquo;t likely be able to use it ever again. There are a few fun apps that you should be able to download for free though.<a href="http://m.opera.com/"> Opera Web Browser</a> most likely works much better than the default web browser. There is a<a href="http://gmail-mobile.en.softonic.com/java"> Gmail</a> app that still works, but Google does not support it anymore. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if it suddenly stops working when Gmail gets an update. If all else fails, you should at least be able to play<a href="http://www.kiang.org/jordan/software/tetrismidlet/"> Tetris</a>.</p>
<p>TOM: To be honest, if you want apps you probably need to invest in a beefier phone. One that runs iOS, Android or Windows Phone. Those all have app stores with lots of third party apps which will run across a number of different phones.</p>

<html><body><p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2013/03/AngryBloggers.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7038" title="Google is feeling the wrath of angry bloggers." alt="" src="/media/2013/03/AngryBloggers-300x200.jpg"  width="300" height="200"></a>In a statement that has rocked the blogosphere to its core, Google has announced that as part of its annual &lsquo;spring cleaning&rsquo; <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html" target="_blank">it will be shuttering Google Reader</a>:</p>
<blockquote style="padding-left: 30px;"><p>We have just announced on the Official Google Blog that we will soon retire Google Reader (the actual date is July 1, 2013). We know Reader has a devoted following who will be very sad to see it go. We&rsquo;re sad too.</p>
<p>There are two simple reasons for this: usage of Google Reader has declined, and as a company we&rsquo;re pouring all of our energy into fewer products. We think that kind of focus will make for a better user experience.</p>
<p>To ensure a smooth transition, we&rsquo;re providing a three-month sunset period so you have sufficient time to find an alternative feed-reading solution.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is, there <em>is </em>no alternate feed reading solution. Google Reader has become the alpha and omega of RSS feed aggregation.</p>
<p>RSS readers allow you to pull content from multiple blogs and news sites (via &lsquo;feeds&rsquo;) and read them in one location. For an information omnivore like me, they are a must have: a way to parse through dozens or even hundreds of blogs daily for new content without having a bookmark for every single blog that might interest me.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-14/google-unplugs-google-reader-sending-its-loyal-users-elsewhere" target="_blank">BusinessWeek put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote style="padding-left: 30px;"><p><em>But serious RSS users aren&rsquo;t into it for the luscious jpegged&nbsp;beauty. RSS feeds, taken straight, are a wall of text. That&rsquo;s useful when you want to let news wash over you, to scan screenfuls&nbsp;of headlines without waiting for extraneous pictures to load. When I want to absorb a lot of information fast-which is to say, always-I don&rsquo;t have time for Flipboard. I want exactly what Google will be taking away from me this summer.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Lest you think I exaggerate about the sheer volume of content I personally consume via Google Reader, here is a snapshot of the stats from my GR &lsquo;Trends&rsquo; page:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K5uZohsrmWw/UUHpzV0E4hI/AAAAAAAAAgI/Z99VmYfnp5Q/s1600/GoogleReaderStats.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K5uZohsrmWw/UUHpzV0E4hI/AAAAAAAAAgI/Z99VmYfnp5Q/s400/GoogleReaderStats.jpg"  width="400" height="197" border="0"></a></p>
<p>For Google Reader users this is not at all the exception. Reader may have a smaller user-base than other Google tools, but there&rsquo;s no doubt that they are almost all power-users: bloggers, journalists, media-hawks of all stripes. There are several petitions already up at Change.org, one of which has already surpassed 50,000 signatures (<a href="https://www.change.org/petitions/google-keep-google-reader-running" target="_blank">sign it!</a>). The Google Reader support forums are <a href="http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!categories/reader/something-is-broken" target="_blank">choked with wails of agony</a>. And Reader-dependent journalists from every virtually every news organization are<a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;q=google+reader&amp;oq=google+reader&amp;gs_l=news-cc.3..43j43i53.2711.4078.0.4253.13.5.0.8.8.0.77.357.5.5.0...0.0...1ac.1.3ceXOkjiM2o" target="_blank"> noting its passing</a>.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other RSS readers out there. The problem is, even if you don&rsquo;t use Google Reader <em>you probably actually use Google Reader</em>. Google Reader&rsquo;s powerful back-end synchronizes your feeds and the content you have and haven&rsquo;t read across multiple devices. Most feed readers currently on the market, from desktop clients to smartphone apps, take advantage of this by plugging into it. The developers of these readers will now be scrambling to come up with their own back-end solutions before the service sunsets on July 1st.</p>
<p>Should a viable alternative not emerge, this could spell big trouble for the small blogs of the world. I read Tyler Cowen&rsquo;s &lsquo;Marginal Revolution&rsquo; blog every day and would probably remember to check it without a feed reader. But I follow other, smaller blogs, often blogs written by friends, which update irregularly. If you follow&nbsp;<a title="Tom Noir.com" href="http://www.tomnoir.com/" target="_blank">my blog</a> this is the case for you too: I don&rsquo;t update daily, so without some sort of feed you&rsquo;d have to remember to manually check this blog now and again.</p>
<p>Again, Google Reader is not the only way to do this, but it is the <em>main</em>&nbsp;way people do it. Google Reader has been in service since 2005 and has garnered a substantial following in the intervening eight years. As one blogger <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/311984542770659328" target="_blank">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>Drive competing services out of business with a free service (subsidized by a profitable product).</li>
<li>Cancel free service.</li>
<li>???</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>The implications of Google&rsquo;s cancellation of its Reader service go far beyond the loss of a useful tool, as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomwatson/2013/03/13/googles-strange-attack-on-bloggers-and-the-public-internet-the-massive-reaction-to-reader-shutdown/" target="_blank">a Forbes blogger bitterly notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Does Google understand the concept of corporate social responsibility? That seems to be the basic question around the company&rsquo;s strange decision to shut down a tiny service that serves as a major audience conduit for many thousands of bloggers, citizen journalists, and self publishers.</em></p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s announcement today that it is destroying Google Reader, the most popular RSS syndication tool was a massive blow to the blogging community &ndash; and to most of those speaking out tonight via social media, an entirely unnecessary attack on an important corner of the public Internet by a company with more than $50 billion in revenue and a newly won reputation as a tech giant on the move.</p></blockquote>
<p>Google&rsquo;s decision is also shaking the faith of myself and many others in the Google eco-system. If Google is willing to pull the plug on Reader, what tool or service that we use might be next to get the axe at the search giant&rsquo;s whim? Perhaps Blogger? If Google is getting out of blogs entirely I&rsquo;ll be forced to move TomNoir.com in its entirety to some other blog service.</p>
<p>Several voices have pointed out that Google Reader is probably not very profitable for Google. It does serve up some ads, but in a minimalist fashion. Meanwhile, even if it isn&rsquo;t actively developing the service anymore it <em>does </em>have to maintain the back-end servers. So maybe it makes good business sense for Google to put the axe to reader.</p>
<p>Or does it? Google Reader is a wildly successful product by the standards of any ordinary software company. Its user base must number in the hundreds-of-thousands, if not millions. Only to a company that measures web traffic by the hundreds of millions and even <em>billions</em> would this seem like a dismal flop. Google is viewing Reader through the same lens with which it views its other products: as a service to drive ad revenue.</p>
<p>This is a mistake.</p>
<p>If Google&rsquo;s give-it-away-free model doesn&rsquo;t make sense for Google Reader, why not try charging for the service? Google could charge the other feed readers that use its back-end API. Or it could even charge its users. <em>I would pay</em>. Google Reader is absolutely worth, say, $30/year to me.</p>
<p>You hear that, Google? You&rsquo;ve got a user base you could actually <em>monetize</em>! If only you will listen before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>Otherwise you&rsquo;re killing off the thriving-but-often-invisible universe of small blogs. You&rsquo;re alienating a base of vocal power-users. And you&rsquo;re shattering those users&rsquo; faith in your willingness to continue supporting services you&rsquo;ve developed.</p>

<html><body><p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6943" title="iPhones Don't Belong In Jail" alt="" src="/media/2013/03/iPhoneInJail.jpg" width="339" height="339">Even though I am otherwise quite tech savvy, there has always been one realm of geekdom that I have always been&nbsp;hesitant&nbsp;to enter: the world of Jailbreaking. I blame my mother. I love my mom&nbsp;immensely, but when we got our first desktop computer, complete with DOS 5.0 and WordPerfect, she rained down&nbsp;hell-fire&nbsp;in warning me not to break it. In that otherwise sweet, gentle woman&rsquo;s eyes I saw fire and heat and lava that day. So, suffice it to say that when I accidentally formatted the hard drive I was grounded for the rest of my life. (I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m still supposed to go to bed by ten, even on the weekends.)</p>
<p>None the less, I am a grown man now, and I bought my iPhone with my own money. So, I can jailbreak it if I want to, right? I want to be able to customize iOS so that it works the way I want it to. I want to be able to install apps other than the ones that have been officially sanctioned by Apple. I&rsquo;m quite savvy enough to do it, too. I&rsquo;m not going to accidentally format my iPhone! Well, turns out it&rsquo;s so easy to jailbreak an iPhone these, days, almost anyone can do it. Here&rsquo;s the breakdown:</p>
<p>These instructions are for an iPhone running iOS 6 through 6.1.2. (As of 3/21/2013, this will not work with version 6.1.3. The&nbsp;6.1.3 update broke the exploit that evasi0n uses to jailbreak the iPhone.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4113">Turn off the passcode on your iPhone</a> if you have one set up. It can cause problems with the procedure.</p>
<p>First, open iTunes on your computer.<br><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2013/03/Jailbreak1.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img title="iTunes Screenshot" alt="" src="/media/2013/03/Jailbreak1.jpg"  width="368" height="265"></a></p>
<p>Plug in your iPhone, and open the iTunes Library by clicking the Library button on the right.<br><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2013/03/jailbreak2.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img title="Screenshot of iTunes" alt="" src="/media/2013/03/jailbreak2.png"  width="368" height="265"></a></p>
<p>Once it has loaded, click the iPhone button at the top right.<br><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2013/03/jailbreak3.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img title="iTunes Screenshot" alt="" src="/media/2013/03/jailbreak3.jpg"  width="368" height="265"></a></p>
<p>On the next screen, click the Back Up Now button to save a backup of your iPhone. This is important because if something goes wrong, you&rsquo;ll need this to restore your iPhone.</p>
<p>Once the back up process is complete, eject your iPhone by clicking the Eject button next to your iPhone&rsquo;s name. Then, close iTunes.</p>
<p>Open your web browser to http://www.evasi0n.com/ Note, that is the number zero before the n, not the letter o.<br><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2013/03/jailbreak4.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img title="evasi0n.com Screenshot" alt="" src="/media/2013/03/jailbreak4.png"  width="368" height="265"></a></p>
<p>Click the blue button at the bottom that corresponds with your Operating System, Linux, Mac OS X or Windows.<br><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2013/03/jailbreak4.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img title="evasi0n.com Screenshot" alt="" src="/media/2013/03/jailbreak5.png"  width="368" height="265"></a></p>
<p>Once the zip file has downloaded, open it. Extract the files to your desktop or somewhere that you can remember.</p>
<p>Open the folder that was created, and open the file titled ?evasi0n.exe.?<img title="Screenshot of evasi0n 1.5.1" alt="" src="/media/2013/03/jailbreak6.png" width="486" height="352"></p>
<p>Now, plug your iPhone back in, and click Jailbreak.<br><img title="Screenshot of evasi0n" alt="" src="/media/2013/03/jailbreak7.png" width="486" height="352"></p>
<p>The installation process will go through several steps. Don&rsquo;t touch your iPhone until the screen starts flashing with the following message:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To continue, please unlock your device and tap the new &lsquo;Jailbreak&rsquo; icon&hellip;&rdquo;<br><img alt="" src="/media/2013/03/jailbreak8.png" width="486" height="352"></p>
<p>The process will continue, and the iPhone will reboot a few times. You may now press Exit.</p>
<p><img title="evasi0n screenshot finished" alt="" src="/media/2013/03/jailbreak9.png" width="486" height="352"></p>
<p>Now, you will find the Cydia Store app icon on your iPhone.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-6941 alignnone" alt="The Cydia Store App icon" src="/media/2013/03/jailbreak10.jpg" width="148" height="178"></p>
<p>You are now officially jailbroken! Congratulations!</p>
<p>Now, you can start trying out new addons, keyboards, tweaks, themes, and apps! Remember, use caution. The Cydia store is not anywhere near as controlled &nbsp;as the App Store is. Things might not always work the way you expect them to. Read the descriptions and feel free to contact the developer if you have a question that they haven&rsquo;t answered. If you need help getting around Cydia, look for the User Guides down the page on the Home screen.</p>
<p>If you change your mind and decide you want to go back, here&rsquo;s a guide on <a href="http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57462343-285/how-to-unjailbreak-your-iphone-ipad-or-ipod-touch/">how to unjailbreak your iPhone.</a></p>

<html><body><p>&ldquo;Fish and visitors smell after three days.&rdquo; &ndash; Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve survived and (dare I say, enjoyed) the 2012 Holidays with your distant relatives. It&rsquo;s nice getting the family together for a few days. The hustle and bustle of the holidays can be overwhelming and the sudden silence after guests leave can be gloomy. &nbsp;Technology can make the transition back to everyday life a lot easier.</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/2013/01/5-ways-to-keep-in-touch/sisters-at-christmas/" rel="attachment wp-att-6582"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-6582" alt="Sisters at Christmas" src="/media/2013/01/Sisters-at-Christmas-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225"></a></p>
<p>If your brother and his family live in Seattle, Washington and you live in Jacksonville, Florida, chances are you won&rsquo;t be able to afford to see him or your cute nieces and nephews more than a few times a year. You don&rsquo;t have to rack up thousands of frequent flier miles to be a good aunt or uncle; use these five ways to keep in touch:</p>
<ol><ol><li><a title="Skype's Website" href="www.skype.com" target="_blank">Skype</a><br>
If everyone has a webcam and fast enough wifi, Skype provides an inexpensive way to sing &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; to any friend or family member anywhere on the globe. It works on Android and iOS, allowing it to work on most smartphones and computers. The video quality isn&rsquo;t always the best but the price is free if both people have Skype. If you want to do a group video call, there is a premium option explained <a title="Skype Premium" href="http://beta.skype.com/en/premium/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li><a title="Apple's FaceTime" href="http://www.apple.com/ios/facetime/" target="_blank">FaceTime</a><br>
iMac, iPhone, iPod, iPad. These will all come pre-installed with FaceTime. This application uses the built-in webcam &nbsp;to connect people across the city and around the world. The video quality tends to be a little better than Skype but it only works if everyone owns an Apple product.</li>
<li><a title="Google Chat" href="https://www.google.com/chat/video" target="_blank">Google Chat<br></a>With a free Google or Gmail account, you can instant message or video chat with friends around the globe. The account is free and with <a title="Google + Hangouts" href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/" target="_blank">Google+</a> you can create a Hangout that allows group video chat.</li>
<li><a title="Facebook" href="www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a><br>
Privacy concerns may be an issue for some people but if enough of your friends and family are on Facebook, it can be worthwhile for you to be as well. Facebook events and private group messages can make Grandma&rsquo;s Surprise Birthday Party the event of the year. Remember to make the event Private and Invite Only otherwise it won&rsquo;t be a surprise from Grandma.</li>
<li>Cellphone or Landline<br>
If you can&rsquo;t touch or see someone, sometime&rsquo;s voice is the next best thing. Check your cellphone plan to see when it&rsquo;s the cheapest to call. Free nights and weekends, mobile-to-mobile, and unlimited texting are possible perks of a contract cellphone.</li>

<html><body><p>Happy New Year! If you are reading this post, we at Deemable Tech will assume you made it home safely last night.</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/2013/01/2013-tech-resolutions/technology-fireworks/" rel="attachment wp-att-6545"><img class=" wp-image-6545 alignleft" style="border: 0px;margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 25px" alt="technology fireworks" src="/media/2013/01/technology-fireworks-300x261.jpg" width="231" height="201"></a></p>
<p>Ready to make 2013 New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions? Instead of swearing of chocolate and bread for the year, why not make some improvements in your use of technology?</p>
<p>Here are a few resolutions to get you started:</p>
<ul><li><strong>I will protect and upkeep my electronics.<br></strong>Did you make out like a bandit and get lots of cool stuff for Christmas? Now is the time to buy a screen protector and a case, my friend.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>I will do my research before buying a new gadget.<br></strong>It&rsquo;s the&nbsp;best/shiniest/biggest/smallest version ever! Do you need it at the midnight release or can it wait six months for the price to drop? Stay tuned to our site and we&rsquo;ll keep you in the loop.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>I will put down my cellphone / tablet / e-reader when interacting with friends and family.<br></strong>Work on building personal relationships instead of beating their high score on Words with Friends.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>I will set up automated banking so I can save up for the next gadget and pay my bills on time.<br></strong>In the age of online banking and virtual billing statements, it is easier than ever to set up a firm financial foundation. Services such as <a href="http://www.smartypig.com/">SmartyPig</a>&nbsp;can provide a seamless way to automatically take $10 or $15 and sock it away until you save enough for a bigger television or the next laptop.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>I will organize my email inbox.<br></strong>Do you have hundreds of emails in your inbox? Start the year off by eliminating some of the digital clutter you&rsquo;ve accrued. You can delete the newsletter from March 2012, &nbsp;we promise.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>I will change my passwords monthly.<br></strong>Want to make it easy for a stranger to access your email, banking information, and social media accounts? Use a different password for each one and change it every month or two. It will make it more difficult for you to remember your passwords but it will also provide a deterrent to unauthorized users hacking your accounts.</li>
</ul><p>What are your New Year&rsquo;s Resolutions? Let us know in the comments.</p>
