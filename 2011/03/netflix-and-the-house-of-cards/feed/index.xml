		<description><![CDATA[You kids and your new fangled toys! I do not want to upgrade. At least not until they get the pixelation on the HDTVs smoothed out. I am assuming that will take faster processors or something. It makes me sick to my stomach when I watch a lot of the newer HDTVs. I am more than happy watching my analog signal on my old monster flat screen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What is the &quot;HD&quot; issue? Do they not have a lot of HD content? I have yet to make the jump. My old flatscreen is just so pretty, and it is massive!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My first thought when reading this was &quot;how smart&quot;. My second thought was whether NetFlix was going to address their HD issue. Is that a valid concern?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am really excited. I have been a Netflix fanatic ever since we originally got the disc for our Wii. My wife and I work opposite shifts, so Netflix is really the only way we can watch television together with any sense of normalcy. Also, we really enjoy watching only one show uninterrupted until we finish the series or the season. It is much nicer than watching the same show week by week when it comes on the air. The experience is akin to reading a good book; you get more of the subtle jokes and reference that you would otherwise miss. 

Because of that, and the fact that I have enjoyed almost every movie that I have seen Kevin Spacey in, I am definitely going to check out “House of Cards”.]]></description>
