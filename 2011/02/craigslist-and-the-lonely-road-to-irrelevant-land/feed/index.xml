		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure that I agree with all your solutions to fix CL, but for the personals section at least, it seems the problem is exactly the opposite: not enough stuff is being flagged and deleted and it&#039;s &#062;80% spam and fake ads looking to harvest phone numbers and Kik or Snapchat names since CL neutered their doing so with e-mail addys via their relay system. (Part of that problem is a lack of critical thinking skills both for folks browsing and potentially replying to ads and in posting them. One aspect of that is the internet itself and Google that makes everything seemingly local, that you can look up events and streets and virtually wander around cities thousands of miles away.) 

It&#039;s still heading for Irrelevant Land though for that reason, too.


PS: 30 employees seems like an overestimate, but I won&#039;t formally question your assertion. ;)]]></description>
