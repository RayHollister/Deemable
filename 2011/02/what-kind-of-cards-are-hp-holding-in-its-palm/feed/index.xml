		<description><![CDATA[Not exactly, Cristi. Android did not have any multitasking until version 2.1 when the Nexus One was updated. Also, the type of multitasking that Android and Apple has is about as advanced as&#160;the old Palm OS had in&#160;years ago. For the most part, with the exception of a very limited amount of background services, the app is frozen when it is in the background. You can&#039;t really do two or more things at once. You can just leave what you were doing and come back to it later.

&#060;a href=&quot;http://davidquintana.com/entry/mobile-multitasking&quot;&#062;David Quintana&#060;/a&#062; explained it well: &quot;On Android, apps are suspended when they are no longer visible to the user. Suspended means the app is still in memory, but it is frozen. No processing or event handling happens.&quot;
&#160;
Whereas a WebOS device can actually do two or more things at once. For example, in the morning, I launch 5 cards with my favorite news sites on them. While they load I play Angry Birds. Then, I open my favorite YouTube video and let it download while I read my email.]]></description>
