<html><body><p><a href="//wp-content/uploads/2011/06/webos-break-up.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright" title='The "webOS" Break Up' src="//wp-content/uploads/2011/06/webos-break-up-300x300.jpg"  alt='The "webOS" Break Up' width="300" height="300"></a>Dear HP webOS,</p>
<p>When I <a title="Palm announces webOS platform -- Engadget" href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/08/palm-announces-web-os-platform/" target="_blank">first met you</a>, you took my breath away. I fell in love with you at first sight. The way you <a title="Palm Pre Review | Multitasking | PreCentral.net" href="http://www.precentral.net/palm-pre-review#Card-View-Multitasking" target="_blank">multitasked was so elegant and simple</a>, and back then, no other mobile OS could even multitask at all. Your <a title="Palm Pre Review | PreCentral.net" href="http://www.precentral.net/palm-pre-review#Notifications" target="_blank">notifications were so polite and beautiful</a>; you never interrupted me or nagged me. Your <a title="Palm USA | HP Touchstone Technology" href="http://www.hpwebos.com/us/products/accessories/touchstone-technology.html" target="_blank">Touchstone wireless charger</a> was so much fun, and the fact that you had a hardware keyboard and a touch screen was just so sexy. Our relationship was so easy. I never had to share you with a computer; you just downloaded all of your updates over the air. You kept track of everything on Google and Facebook and pulled it all together with <a title="Palm Pre Review | Synergy | PreCentral.net" href="http://www.precentral.net/palm-pre-review#Synergy" target="_blank">Synergy</a>, and you never made me synchronize you. You took care of everything in the background, and I could just enjoy quality spending time with you.</p>
<p>When we got together, I was just getting out of the relationship with your older sister, Palm OS, and you were there to help me through the pain of the break up. I had flirted with iOS (she just called herself iPhone OS back then) before you and I got together, but I missed being around your folks so much that being with you just felt natural. Even though a lot of my friends gave me a hard time because you didn&rsquo;t do as much as iOS and Android did, you were learning so much, so fast.&nbsp; It seemed like we were only together a few months, and you already had <a title="The Official HP Palm Blog: What's new in Palm webOS 1.4?" href="http://blog.palm.com/palm/2010/02/whats-new-in-palm-webos-14.html" target="_blank">video recording </a>and you had&nbsp;<a title="Palm Introduces 3D Games for webOS." href="http://investor.palm.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=436243" target="_blank">3D games</a>.</p>
<p>However, I think I may have rushed into this relationship too fast, and forgot to get to know you first. We should have taken our time. For example, I thought that you would <a title="WebOS to Support Palm OS Emulation | PreCentral.net |  The #1 Palm Pre and Pixi Community" href="http://www.precentral.net/webos-support-palm-os-emulation" target="_blank">support Palm OS and me still being friends</a>, but it wasn&rsquo;t too long before you <a title="With webOS 2.0, MotionApps drops Classic PalmOS Emulator in Palm's lap | PreCentral.net |  The #1 Palm Pre and Pixi Community" href="http://www.precentral.net/webos-2-0-motionapps-drops-classic-palmos-emulator-palm-s-lap" target="_blank">insisted that we never speak again</a>. I thought that you told me that you would <a title="Native Office Document Editing on the Pre | PreCentral.net" href="http://www.precentral.net/native-office-document-editing-pre" target="_blank">support full document editing at launch</a>, but here we are over two years later, and you still can&rsquo;t even edit a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>For several months now, I&rsquo;ve felt us growing farther and farther apart. I don&rsquo;t blame you for what happened. I think it was one of those things where we drifted apart for all sorts of reasons, including <a title="Palm Cuts Its Forecast, and Its Shares Fall - NYTimes.com" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/technology/26palm.html" target="_blank">your near bankruptcy</a>, the <a title="HP to Acquire Palm for $1.2 Billion" href="http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2010/100428xa.html" target="_blank">merger with HP</a>, and the pressure of supporting you through your <a title="Palm's Major Credibility Problem - CNBC" href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/35607982/site/14081545" target="_blank">various crises</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a fool for leaving you, especially now, but I just need some time to find myself. I know that you are on the <a title="HP webOS 3.0: what we know, what we don't" href="http://www.precentral.net/hp-webos-3-0-what-we-know-what-we-don-t" target="_blank">verge of some major breakthroughs</a>. You keep telling me that you are going to change &ldquo;<a title="Round Table: In the coming months | PreCentral.net" href="http://www.precentral.net/round-table-coming-months" target="_blank">in the coming months</a>&rdquo; and now &ldquo;<a title="HP Responds: Veer's &quot;Big Push&quot; is coming &quot;In the Weeks Ahead&quot;  | webOSroundup" href="http://www.webosroundup.com/2011/05/hp-responds-veers-big-push-is-coming-in-the-weeks-ahead/" target="_blank">in the coming weeks</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;Honestly though, I am afraid&nbsp;that you aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;really going to change, because the way you have talked about <a title='Big Talk from HP Europe: TouchPad will be "Better than #1" with thousands of big name apps | PreCentral.net | The #1 Palm Pre and Pixi Community' href="http://www.precentral.net/hp-europe-talks-big-touchpad-will-be-better-1-thousands-big-name-apps" target="_blank">how you are going to</a> change <a title="HP thinks the TouchPad will be 'better than number one,' if that's even possible -- Engadget" href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/23/hp-thinks-the-touchpad-will-be-better-than-number-one-if-that/" target="_blank">doesn&rsquo;t instill confidence</a>. It just sounds like <a title="Apotheker: HP to ship products within weeks of announcement, wants to sit at the cool kids table | PreCentral.net | The #1 Palm Pre and Pixi Community" href="http://www.precentral.net/apotheker-hp-ship-products-within-weeks-announcement-wants-sit-cool-kids-table" target="_blank">the puffed up bravado you&rsquo;ve given me in the past</a>. Ultimately, you <a title='webOS 2.0 will be released to "all devices" in coming months (Update: Video online) | PreCentral.net | The #1 Palm Pre and Pixi Community' href="http://www.precentral.net/webos-2-0-will-be-released-all-devices-coming-months-update-video-online" target="_blank">made me promises</a> that <a title="No major webOS OTA Updates to Pre, Pre Plus, Pixi, Pixi Plus - Updated: none at all | PreCentral.net | The #1 Palm Pre and Pixi Community" href="http://www.precentral.net/no-major-webos-ota-updates-pre-pre-plus-pixi-pixi-plus" target="_blank">you didn&rsquo;t keep</a>, and I think that&rsquo;s what hurt me the most. Some people have acted like that it <a title='TOO SOON? YouTube Video Pokes Fun at webOS "Whiners" (UPDATE! We Find TWO Opposing Videos) | webOSroundup' href="http://www.webosroundup.com/2011/02/too-soon-youtube-video-pokes-fun-at-webos-whiners/" target="_blank">shouldn&rsquo;t bother me</a>, and told me that, ultimately, it was <a title="Making the Case: Why HP isn't allowing OTA updates (and why we think it's a good thing) | webOSroundup" href="http://www.webosroundup.com/2011/02/making-the-case-why-hp-isnt-allowing-ota-updates-and-why-we-think-it-is-a-good-thing/" target="_blank">the right decision for you to make</a>, but it still makes it hard to trust you.</p>
<p>I think we both know this hasn&rsquo;t been working out. It&rsquo;s been over a while now, and last weekend I &lsquo;moved-on&rsquo;. I need to tell you that someone from my past, iOS,&nbsp;has come back into my life. I knew her years ago but there were so many things that <a title="The iPhone is the worst... BGR" href="http://www.bgr.com/2010/10/22/the-iphone-is-the-worst/" target="_blank">interfered with her and I having a relationship</a> that could not be overcome, but <a title="Apple announces iOS 5: 1500 new APT for developers, 200 new features for users | TiPb" href="http://www.tipb.com/2011/06/06/apple-announces-ios-5-1500-api-developers-200-features-users/" target="_blank">that has passed</a> and although <a title="iOS 5: What we didn't get | TiPb" href="http://www.tipb.com/2011/06/07/ios-5/" target="_blank">she is still not perfect</a>, she and I are making another attempt. We were at the Apple store, and well, one thing lead to another and she ended up coming home with me.</p>
<p>I think that we&rsquo;ll be better off apart than we were together. You don&rsquo;t need me.&nbsp;I know you have a lot of <a title="HP webOS Marketing Blitz to feature Lady Gaga, Russel Brand, Jay-Z, Kanye West? | PreCentral.net | The #1 Palm Pre and Pixi Community" href="http://www.precentral.net/hp-webos-marketing-blitz-feature-lady-gaga-russel-brand-jay-z-kanye-west" target="_blank">friend who are supporting you now</a>, and I know <a title="Editorial: The un-penetrated market of non-smartphone users | PreCentral.net" href="http://www.precentral.net/editorial-un-penetrated-market-non-smartphone-users" target="_blank">you&rsquo;ll find someone else</a>. I loved you more than I probably will ever <a title="webOS Users: The most passionately in love with their platform | PreCentral.net" href="http://www.precentral.net/webos-users-most-passionately-love-their-platform" target="_blank">love another mobile OS</a>. If things don&rsquo;t work out with iOS, maybe we&rsquo;ll be together again someday, if it&rsquo;s our fate. Either way, I hope we can still be friends. My contract doesn&rsquo;t run out for another few months, so I&rsquo;d still like to hang out with you from time to time. Also, I still have a lot of stuff I need to get from your place, and move over to iOS&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Again, I really am sorry. I wish we could have made this work.</p>
<p>Goodbye webOS.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">P.S. I&rsquo;m sorry I had to do this in writing instead of in person, but at least I didn&rsquo;t just leave you a Post-it note, right?</p>
