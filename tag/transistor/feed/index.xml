<p>3-D Tri-Gate. While it might sound like a mix between Trident gum and the Watergate scandal, Tri-Gate is actually a revolutionary 3-D transistor designed by Intel that will soon be put into high-volume manufacturing. As the microscopic building block of modern electronics, transistors are semiconductor devices that are used to switch and amplify electronic signals.</p>
<p>For decades, the 2-D planar transistor structure has powered nearly every electronics device, and now, Intel has announced that it will be putting their new 3-D transistors into high-volume production at the 22-nanometer node in an Intel processor &ndash; simply known as &ldquo;Ivy Bridge&rdquo;. The Tri-Gate transistors will help Intel keep pace with Moore&rsquo;s Law, named after Intel&rsquo;s co-founder, Gordon Moore, which describes a trend in computing hardware in which the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit doubles nearly every two years. This is a <em>huge </em>breakthrough in transistor technology.</p>
<p>You may be asking, &ldquo;Why should I care?&rdquo; Well, the new 3-D Tri-Gate transistors will be <em>much</em> faster, <em>much</em> smaller, and consume up to 50% less power. Intel, the largest provider of PC processors, says that the new 3-D  transistors are so small that more than 100 million could fit on the  head of a pin. Ivy Bridge is also said to be 37% more efficient than the best  of Intel&rsquo;s current chips at low voltage, and could help Intel break  into the mobile arena of smartphones and tablets. Although the mass production of Ivy Bridge won&rsquo;t begin until later this   year or early next year, Intel began demonstrating prototypes of   computers and servers running the new 3-D chip yesterday at a news   conference. We are now witnessing the future of technology in transition!</p>
