<p>British police announced that they arrested a 19-year-old in Essex, outside London, in possible connection with the hacking of Sony, <a title="LulzSec attacks the CIA" href="//tech/2011/06/lulzsec-hackers-attacking-the-internet/" target="_blank">the CIA</a>, and the UK&rsquo;s Serious Organized Crime Agency.&nbsp;The joint operation between the Scotland Yard and the FBI&nbsp;&ldquo;follows an investigation into network intrusions and distributed denial of service attacks against a number of international business and intelligence agencies by what is believed to be the same hacking group. Searches at a residential address in Wickford, Essex, following the arrest last night have led to the examination of a significant amount of material,? <a title="Mashable" href="http://mashable.com/2011/06/21/lulzsec-mastermind-suspect-arrested/" target="_blank">said a Scotland Yard spokesman</a>.&nbsp;In Britain, it is illegal to name suspects who have been arrested but the spokesman said that the arrested man&rsquo;s&nbsp;computers will also be examined for activities linked between the suspect and LulzSec.</p>
<p>London&rsquo;s Metropolitan Police said the man is being interrogated in a London police station, and it is suspected that he is in violation of the British Computer Misuse Act and Fraud Act. A related article on Wired.com <a title="Wired.com" href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/06/lulzsec_bust/" target="_blank">says</a>, &ldquo;The&nbsp;<em>Guardian</em> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jun/21/hackers-lulzsec-arrest-essex-census">identified</a> the suspect as Ryan Cleary of Wickford, Essex. In May, the griefer group Anonymous ? now a LulzSec ally ? outed Cleary as a Anonymous member called &lsquo;viraL&rsquo; who&rsquo;d attempted an internal coup in an Anonymous chat room. Phone calls to Cleary&rsquo;s last known number went directly to voice mail Tuesday.&rdquo; The alleged suspect, Ryan Cleary&nbsp;is <a title="Ryan Cleary" href="http://arstechnica.com/security/news/2011/06/lulzsec-blamed-for-uk-census-theft-hacker-arrest-lulzsec-denies-everything.ars" target="_blank">said to have been</a> &ldquo;responsible for running one of the IRC servers used by AnonOps, a faction of the Anonymous group that co-ordinated attacks on both perceived &lsquo;enemies&rsquo; of WikiLeaks and various Middle Eastern governments, until an&nbsp;acrimonious split last month. Subsequently, he is believed to have been a member of Lulz Security, responsible for running that group&rsquo;s IRC server.&rdquo; LulzSec has denied that the arrested suspect is their proposed ringleader by posting the message in the image above on their Twitter site, which has over 230,000 followers.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning, as LulzSec has teamed up with another major hacking Group, Anonymous, who together have <a title="Cyber War" href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/06/20/technology/lulzsec_anonymous/index.htm?hpt=te_bn7" target="_blank">declared a cyber war</a> against government and security agencies around the world.</p>
