<html><body><p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2012/09/nokia-lumia-920-color-range.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5458" src="/media/2012/09/nokia-lumia-920-color-range-300x300.jpg"  alt="" width="300" height="300"></a>Wednesday at a New York City press event, Nokia unveiled two new Windows 8 phones: the <a title="Nokia Lumia 920 specs" href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/lumia920/specifications/" target="_blank">Nokia Lumia 920</a> and the <a title="Nokia Lumia 820 specs" href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/lumia820/specifications/" target="_blank">Nokia Lumia 820</a>.</p>
<p>A Microsoft representative was present at the event to show off some of the phone&rsquo;s Windows 8-specific features. The company has apparently taken a page from the Google playbook and decided that Windows 8 phones need a flagship, similar to Android&rsquo;s Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone. It would appear that the Nokia Lumia 920 is that flagship.</p>
<p>Nokia is an interesting choice as Microsoft&rsquo;s primary partner for Windows Phone 8 as the company has been hemorrhaging market share to Samsung and HTC in the last couple years, while posting billion dollar losses.</p>
<p>The Lumia 920 that Nokia showed off at Wednesday&rsquo;s event looked impressive, however, with a major focus on a powerful camera that uses ?floating lens&rsquo; technology to stabilize video and take high-quality photographs in low-light situations. Another camera-based integrated feature is ?City Lens&rsquo;, an augmented reality app that tags the environment around the user with information about businesses and restaurants. Nokia is marketing the screen on the phone as ?HD+&rsquo; and claims that it shows up well even in direct sunlight.</p>
<p>The phone also boasts native support for the Qi wireless charging standard.</p>
<p>Nokia has not neglected its new phones&rsquo; styling: the 920 comes in a variety of bright, vibrant colors including ?spectacular yellow, stunning lipstick red and seductive gray.? The 820 features easily swappable snap-on backs in a variety of colors. Both phones boast a rounded form-factor, including curved Gorilla Glass screens. Customers are certainly unlikely to confuse the new Nokia Lumia phones with any other smartphone.</p>
<p>There were a couple small flies in the ointment after the unveiling. Nokia admitted that its impressive side-by-side image stabilization comparisons were not shot with the actual phone. They have now <a title="Nokia's apology and updated demo" href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/09/06/an-apology-is-due/" target="_blank">posted a new demo video</a>&nbsp;using the actual phone. While the Lumia 920&rsquo;s stabilized video certainly compares favorably against the iPhone 4s, it&rsquo;s not as effortlessly smooth as the original demo video. Some bloggers are also <a href="http://sefsar.com/nokia-faked-the-still-photos-too" target="_blank">calling some of the demo images of the phone&rsquo;s low-light photo capabilities into question</a>, but we&rsquo;ll probably have to wait until the phone is out in the wild to see how its night-shot camera really stacks up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no word yet on the official release date although it will probably coincide closely with the official release of Windows 8. The final&nbsp;phone is expected&nbsp;to boast a 1.5GHz dual-core Snapdragon S4&nbsp;processor and 32 mb of on-board memory (no expandable SD slot, though). Pricing and carriers have yet to be announced.</p>
<p>Both Microsoft and Nokia have a lot riding on the new Lumia phones. Microsoft needs to get a ?must-have&rsquo; Windows 8 phone into the marketplace in order to&nbsp;seriously compete with iOS and Android. And Nokia desperately needs a big hit to help it regain its old position as a major phone maker, or at least put it back in the black.</p>
