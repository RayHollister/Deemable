<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there any way to completely block pop-up ads while running Chrome or Internet Explorer? I have turned on the built-in pop-up blocker on both, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop them on many of the sites I visit. What is up with that? I have to wonder what the point of blocking pop-ups is when so many get through anyway, slowing down the page loading to the point that it reminds me of being on dial-up.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> To be honest, Bill, it&rsquo;s been so long since we have dealt with a pop-up that we had forgotten Chrome and Internet Explorer even had settings to block them. To turn on the pop-up blocker in Chrome, click the button at the top right of the screen that has three horizontal lines. Then click on &ldquo;Settings,&rdquo; and search for &ldquo;pop-ups&rdquo; in the search box. In Internet Explorer, click on &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; and then go to &ldquo;Internet Options.&rdquo; There you can find the setting under the &ldquo;Privacy&rdquo; tab. Recent versions of Firefox have this option too, and you can find it under the Firefox settings.</p>

<p>But as you say, Bill, these settings don&rsquo;t always work. Why is that? Well, you have to understand that pop-up blocking is like an arms race. Every time there&rsquo;s some new advance in pop-up blocker technology, the people making the pop-up ads just get smarter.</p>
<p>To make things even more complicated, browser-makers can&rsquo;t simply ban all pop-ups. There are lots of legitimate uses for pop-ups &ndash; in fact, half of the websites on the Internet would stop working without them.</p>
<p>Now, the other way to deal with pop-up ads is with what Firefox calls &ldquo;extensions&rdquo;. Extensions are small programs you can download which add features to your browser, including more effective pop-up blocking. Extensions also work for Chrome and Internet Explorer, where they&rsquo;re known as &ldquo;plug-ins&rdquo; and &ldquo;add-ons&rdquo;, respectively.</p>
<p>One of the most popular ones is <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">Ad Block Plus</a>, which is available for both Firefox and Chrome. It&rsquo;s an industrial strength pop-up killer, and we&rsquo;ve found it effectively blocks most pop-ups. Another good plug-in we&rsquo;ve found for Chrome is called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-pop-up-blocker/nmpeeekfhbmikbdhlpjbfmnpgcbeggic?hl=en">Better Pop-Up Blocker</a>. You can find either one of these by just searching for it in Google. Try keywords like &ldquo;Chrome pop-up blocker&rdquo;, and you should get some very helpful results.</p>
<p>Your options are more limited on Internet Explorer, but there is an add-on called <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Smart-Popup-Blocker/3000-7786_4-10282837.html">Smart Pop-up Blocker</a> that will block most pop-ups. It&rsquo;s not 100%, but it&rsquo;s the best that we could find.</p>
<p>Regardless of what your favorite browser is, if you&rsquo;re getting fed-up with annoying ads on the websites you frequent, there are tools out there that can make your web-browsing experience a little smoother.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve gotten that out of the way, it&rsquo;s time for a friendly little PSA about pop-up blocking. Many of your favorite free websites are ad-supported, so when you visit one of those sites and you&rsquo;ve got a pop-up blocker running, you may avoid seeing that annoying pop-up ad but you&rsquo;ve also cost that site some ad revenue. So be sure to deploy your pop-up blocker judiciously.</p>
<p>This is such a big issue that the ever-popular Ad Block Plus actually has a setting called &ldquo;allow non-intrusive advertising&rdquo; which is on by default. As the name suggest, this allows many of the less annoying ads through. But keep in mind that the ones that it does block &ndash; the really annoying ones &ndash; may be real money makers for small, independent websites. Ad Block Plus gives you the option to allow pop-ups for certain websites to remedy this. Other pop-up blockers should, at minimum, allow you to turn them on and off.</p>
<p>Please pop-up block responsibly! Ads may be annoying, but they help keep the web free.</p>
