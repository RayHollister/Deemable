<p style="text-align: center">&ndash; Augusto Roa Bastos.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/04/11x0418b7323f.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="515"></p>
<p>My middle school Latin teacher once told me that &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re not cheating,   then you&rsquo;re not trying.&rdquo; While it was obviously meant to be a joke that  I  never took seriously, it&rsquo;s the only thing I can remember from his   class. However, in the world of trademarks, patents, and intellectual  property rights, there is only  the slightest bit of room for humor &ndash; and  Apple is clearly not in the laughing  mood.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon, Apple filed a 38-page lawsuit against Samsung, specifically targeting Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy line which, according to Apple, has &ldquo;slavishly&rdquo; copied the &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; of the iPad and iPhone. Apple alleges that Samsung not only copied the look and feel of its devices, but also copied the applications and the packaging that the devices are housed in. <a title="Wall Street Journal" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703916004576271210109389154.html" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a> adds, &ldquo;Apple is also embroiled in legal battles with companies such as  HTC Corp., Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Nokia Corp.  and Eastman Kodak Co. over products such as smartphones and software,  some of whom it has sued and some of whom it has been sued by.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">While the South Korean company plans on defending itself against the lawsuit, the relationship between the two heavyweight consumer electronics companies may be impacted in the future as several Apple products contain computer chips manufactured by Samsung, including parts of the A4 and A5 processors which are found in iOS devices and Apple TV products.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">It would be an extremely rare case for Apple to <em>win</em> something in court based on their argument that Samsung copied the &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; of their devices, if anything, Apple is just trying to take a stand and make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t <em>lose</em> its competitive advantage over its rivals who are taking business away. Let&rsquo;s face it though; all electronics companies imitate the latest innovative product to hit the market (that&rsquo;s just a part of what makes our economy a free market) and Apple just happens to be leading the way.</p>
