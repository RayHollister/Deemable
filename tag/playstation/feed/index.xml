<p>It&rsquo;s the 100th episode of Deemable Tech. It only took us three years to get here!&nbsp;Jessica Palombo, co-host of the mystical, never aired &ldquo;Deemable Tech Pilot Episode,&rdquo; and current WJCT News Director, joined Ray, Tom and Sean for the big celebration. The foursome talked about Facebook&rsquo;s new &ldquo;dislike&rdquo; button, a new service that promises to be &ldquo;Yelp for humans,&rdquo; Amazon cuts out the competition and some guy who managed to buy the domain&nbsp;&ldquo;Google.com&rdquo; from &mdash; get this &mdash; Google!<span id="more-10303"></span></p>

<h3>Facebook ?Likes&rsquo; rumors of a ?Dislike&rsquo; button</h3>
<p>Pretty much ever since Facebook introduced its ubiquitous ?like&rsquo; button, users have been clamoring for a ?dislike&rsquo; button. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-is-working-on-a-disklike-button-2015-9&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNESLWUmoJTSDf2YlombZDDSLHvrEg">Well last month, Business Insider reported that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had announced that the company was working on one</a>. Only, it isn&rsquo;t quite what you think.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, the world&rsquo;s most dominant social media site isn&rsquo;t about to turn into a den of passive-aggressive backstabbing &ndash; anymore than it already is. Zuck says he wants to give users a way to express sympathy or empathy when someone posts that they are having a bad day or going through a difficult time.</p>
<p>While Facebook&rsquo;s CEO promised that the ?dislike&rsquo; button would appear in the not-too-distant future, as of this recording it is not available. And you should be wary of scams. Gizmodo reports that <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://factually.gizmodo.com/dont-fall-for-the-facebook-dislike-button-scam-1732352168&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBMDi-u-SLQOrXd3yHLTFDe5Y_9Q">ads have started appearing promising that people that take a survey can get early access to the ?dislike&rsquo; button</a>. You can&rsquo;t and you won&rsquo;t. Although you may ?dislike&rsquo; what happens to you if you try.</p>
<h3>The internet gives ?Yelp for Humans&rsquo; a one star rating</h3>
<p>Ever app developer hopes that their app will go viral and gain massive media attention. Last week, one soon-to-be-released app did, although probably not in the way its creators wanted. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/09/30/everyone-you-know-will-be-able-to-rate-you-on-the-terrifying-yelp-for-people-whether-you-want-them-to-or-not/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7yS9IfdLogqgONJkV9u7RSiAIHg">The Washington Post ran a story about an app called Peeple</a>, which founder Julia Cordray billed as ?Yelp for Humans&rsquo;. Supposedly the app would allow you to rate anyone you had a phone # on a 1-5 scale. The people you were rating did not have to be signed up for the app.</p>
<p>Although Cordray promised that there would be controls in place to prevent cyber-bullying and that those who received negative ratings would have 48 hours to respond to them before they were posted, the internet backlash was swift and massive. Within hours, #Peeple was a trending topic on Twitter, with the Tweets about it almost uniformly negative. Peeple&rsquo;s Facebook page was flooded with angry comments. Ironically, Peeple began to delete negative feedback from their Facebook page before taking both it and their Twitter feed offline entirely.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://m.snopes.com/2015/10/01/peeple/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNFkmBDPXjHBSVr6ewJ_mOFVVD_LQg">Snopes.com speculated that Peeple was actually just a hoax</a>&nbsp;intended to rile everyone up. However, there has been no confirmation that it is in fact a hoax at this time.</p>
<p>As of this morning, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/julia-cordray-ceo-peeple-creating-worlds-largest-app-julia-cordray&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqHOZ-BYwSxqCZOtmk-ONuTn1-lg">Peeple founder Julia Cordray has posted a lengthy ?clarification&rsquo; on LinkedIn</a>. In her article, she claims that the purpose of the app has been misunderstood, that it is a ?positivity&rsquo; app, and that it will NOT in fact allow negative reviews or allow reviews of people who have not signed up for the app. This seems directly contradictory to what has been stated about the app before, including in a handful of ?webisodes&rsquo; that the team had posted on YouTube.</p>
<p>A further wrinkle in this crazy only-on-the-internet story: Peeple is also the name of another startup, this one a company which has developed an electronic, wifi-enabled peephole for your front-door. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.wired.com/2015/10/peeple-the-thing-versus-peeple-the-app/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPayX-_WOeKBTXppsfcnYARZwssQ">Wired reports that the other Peeple is less-than-pleased about the unwanted publicity</a>. Since the other Peeple owns the trademark to the name in the US, it is not clear how the app makers will proceed. Should they choose to, their stated release date is in November.</p>
<h2>Random guy buys Google.com from Google for $12</h2>
<p>Mashable reports <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mashable.com/2015/10/01/buys-google-com-for-12/?utm_cid%3Dmash-com-fb-main-link%236tNOquWWjqq1&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzZ2yglbX9reJn1UDSYCMOu2z6Iw">that last week a random guy was able to buy Google.com </a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mashable.com/2015/10/01/buys-google-com-for-12/?utm_cid%3Dmash-com-fb-main-link%236tNOquWWjqq1&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzZ2yglbX9reJn1UDSYCMOu2z6Iw">from Google</a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mashable.com/2015/10/01/buys-google-com-for-12/?utm_cid%3Dmash-com-fb-main-link%236tNOquWWjqq1&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzZ2yglbX9reJn1UDSYCMOu2z6Iw">&nbsp;for the massive price of $12</a>. Sanmay Ved, a student at Babson University, was playing around with Google Domains when he noticed that the site said that &ldquo;Google.com&rdquo; was unclaimed. He added it to his cart, checked out, and a few minutes later had an email informing him of his successful purchase of &ldquo;Google.com.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just a few minutes after that, however, his purchase was mysteriously cancelled. Ved reports that he did notify Google of the glitch after the fact. No word on why Google had its own domain up for sale in the first place.</p>
<p>Mashable notes that Microsoft lost Hotmail.co.uk in a similar glitch in 2003, but had more trouble getting it back.</p>
<h2>Amazon.com to stop carrying competing streaming devices Chromecast and Apple TV</h2>
<p>Competition in the world of streaming TV and movies continues to heat up. Several different companies now offer low-cost solutions that allow users to stream high quality video from several different services on the cheap. The leaders are Google&rsquo;s Chromecast, Apple&rsquo;s Apple TV, and Amazon&rsquo;s Fire TV Stick. Well <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/amazon-will-ban-sale-of-apple-google-video-streaming-devices&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkxlNaEuhFqa8g2WgV67q9_QKZvw">Bloomberg reports that Amazon.com has decided that that is a few competitors too many</a>. It has announced that starting on October 29th it will no longer carry either the Chromecast or the AppleTV in its online store. Just in time for the Christmas season!</p>
<p>Amazon states that the reason for this move is that its competitor&rsquo;s devices don&rsquo;t &ldquo;interact well&rdquo; with Amazon Prime Video. Of course it would appear that it is up to Amazon to develop software for the devices, not the companies that make them.</p>
<p>Other streaming devices, including Roku&rsquo;s set top device and Microsoft&rsquo;s XBox One and Sony&rsquo;s Playstation 4 are not affected</p></body></html>

<p>On Tuesday, Sony unveiled its next-generation portable gaming device, the PlayStation Vita, at the&nbsp;Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles. Sony President of Consumer Products, Kazuo Hirai, said that the PlayStation Vita will&nbsp;&ldquo;revolutionize the portable entertainment experience.&rdquo;&nbsp;As the heavily hyped successor to the PSP, the device looks like it will actually live up to the high standards that Sony has already set for its upcoming product.</p>
<p>The <a title="Vita" href="http://us.playstation.com/psvita/" target="_blank">PlayStation Vita</a> will feature a&nbsp;high-resolution, 5-inch multi-touch OLED touchscreen, 6-axis motion sensors,&nbsp;dual analog sticks, rear touch pad, dual front and back mounted cameras, built-in GPS, and will run on a quad-core ARM Cortex A9 Processor. Even more impressive, Sony announced that the Vita will give users the ability to enjoy continuous, uninterrupted gameplay by&nbsp;allowing for cross-platform play with compatible games on the PlayStation 3. According to Sony, there are over 80 titles already in development, and the company showed off the capabilities of the system with some of the top-tiered titles like a Diablo-like RPG game called <em>Ruin.</em></p>
<p>Last but definitely not least, Sony revealed that the PlayStation Vita will start at the low price of $249 for the Wi-Fi only version and $299 for the 3G model, which AT&amp;T will be the exclusive service provider for &ndash; much to the chagrin of the audience who openly booed the announcement. Price-wise, this means that the PlayStation Vita will be in&nbsp;direct competition to the Nintendo 3DS, which can&rsquo;t really be considered in the same arena of portable gaming once the Vita is released later this year, just in time for the holiday season.</p>

<p>From deadly tornadoes ripping through Missouri to the faulty claims of judgment day&rsquo;s arrival, this has been quite a hectic month. After being granted a week-long hiatus from writing to enjoy a mini-vacation (thanks again Ray), I return to close out the end of May by revisiting some of the trending topics in the tech world and&hellip; well, I might as well throw this out there &ndash; Go Mavericks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Osama" href="//stuff/2011/05/the-worlds-most-wanted-osama-bin-laden/" target="_blank">The World&rsquo;s Most Wanted: Osama bin Laden</a></p>
<p><a title="Puppy" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1753360/the-tech-that-outfits-the-dogs-of-war" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/robodog-620.jpg" alt="" width="377" height="182"></a></p>
<p>Meet Cairo, a member of the Navy SEAL team who helped take out Osama bin Laden with the help of high tech doggie body armor, called the <em>Intruder</em>. Costing up to $30,000, the ultralight vest is not only bulletproof, but the <em>Intruder</em> also has a high-definition camera that is mounted on the war dog&rsquo;s back so that its handlers can see his every movement. Now that&rsquo;s one badass puppy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="PSN" href="//tech/2011/05/reconnected-playstation-network-back-online/" target="_blank">Reconnected: PlayStation Network Back Online</a></p>
<p>What a complete nightmare the PSN outage has become for Sony, but it looks like they have finally gotten things under control as their latest&nbsp;<a title="Press Release" href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/05/30/full-psn-services-including-playstation-store-return-this-week/" target="_blank">Press Release</a> may suggest. However, Sony won&rsquo;t come out unscathed as the company has reportedly lost <a title="Sony losses" href="http://cnn.com/video/?/video/business/2011/05/26/lah.japan.sony.woes.cnn" target="_blank">billions of dollars</a> over the security breach, which has shaken consumer confidence in the PlayStation Network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Matt &amp; Ginny" href="//stuff/2011/05/greatest-marriage-proposal-ever/" target="_blank">Greatest Marriage Proposal Ever?</a></p>
<p>3 million views in 3 days. 15 million views in 2 weeks. That means millions of women saw this marriage proposal video on YouTube throughout the world, leaving millions of women expecting a similar grand gesture of love. F.M.L.? More like &ldquo;F.O.L.&rdquo; for all the guys out there. But hey, at least Matt &amp; Ginny appreciate all the responses you all have given them. Sigh&hellip;</p>

<p>While Steve Jobs is currently on medical leave due to health-related issues, it&rsquo;s not stopping him from delivering the keynote address at Apple&rsquo;s annual Worldwide Developers Conference next Monday. As for Apple&rsquo;s cloud-based music service, it looks like iCloud (or whatever they name it) will allow users to <a title="Mirror" href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/05/report-apple-music-cloud-service-to-auto-add-itunes-store-tracks.ars" target="_blank">mirror their iTunes library</a> as anticipated.</p>

<p><a title="Press Release" href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/05/31wwdc.html" target="_blank">Official Press Release</a><strong>: Apple to Unveil Next Generation Software at Keynote Address on Monday, June 6</strong></p>
<p>CUPERTINO, California?May 31, 2011?Apple&reg; CEO Steve Jobs and a team of  Apple executives will kick off the company&rsquo;s annual Worldwide Developers  Conference (WWDC) with a keynote address on Monday, June 6 at 10:00  a.m. At the keynote, Apple will unveil its next generation software &ndash;  Lion, the eighth major release of Mac OS&reg; X; iOS 5, the next version of  Apple&rsquo;s advanced mobile operating system which powers the iPad&reg;, iPhone&reg;  and iPod touch&reg;; and iCloud&reg;, Apple&rsquo;s upcoming cloud services offering.</p>

<p>After 22 grueling days of outage, gamers and users throughout the world can finally reconnect to the PlayStation Network after Sony carried out a phased restoration process. Although PlayStation store access won&rsquo;t be restored until later, PSN&rsquo;s reactivation restores online multiplayer and chat functions, friends list   and trophy comparison functionality, PlayStation Home, and services like Hulu, Netflix, and MLB.tv. Once logging in, PSN users will be required to update to the latest 3.61 firmware and change their account passwords. Details about changing your password are provided below from the <a title="Password change" href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/05/14/ps3-system-software-update/" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If using a PS3, your password can only be changed on your own PS3 (or a  PS3 on which your PSN account was activated), as an added layer of  security. If you have never downloaded any content using your account on  the system, an email will be sent to the registered sign-in ID (email  address) associated with your account when you first attempt to sign-in  to PSN. This e-mail will contain a link that will enable you to change  your password. In this email, click on the link and follow the  instructions to change your password. Once you have changed your  password you can sign-in to your account using your new password.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down for over 3 weeks after hackers breached the network&rsquo;s security, Sony had to rebuild the entire PlayStation Network with more advanced security technology, encryption, firewalls, and early-warning systems. The outage affected over 77 million users worldwide and, even worse, the security breach may have allowed for the hackers to <a title="stolen information" href="http://mashable.com/2011/05/03/sony-another-hacker-attack/" target="_blank">steal</a> personal credit and debit card information from over 24 million user accounts.</p>
<p>Kazuo Hirai, Sony Corporation&rsquo;s Executive Deputy President, released a <a title="video" href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/05/14/kazuo-hirai-playstation-network-relaunch-announcement/" target="_blank">video statement</a> on the PlayStation Blog providing more detailed information on the restoration of the PlayStation Network and the new security features being implemented.</p>
<p>To compensate for the long outage and compromise of account information, Sony is offering 30 days free membership in the PlayStation Plus service, which provides exclusive access to certain games and beta trials. To those users who are already subscribed to the PlayStation Plus service, an additional 30 days will be added for free. Sony Online Entertainment subscribers will also receive a special <a title="Welcome Back" href="http://www.soe.com/securityupdate/welcomeback/" target="_blank">Welcome Back Program</a> upon return.</p>
<p>At this point though, how many PSN users will even want to return to the network after the massive failure that Sony just dealt with?</p></body></html>

<p>From tornadoes and thundering superstorms, to the dry, blistering heat of the approaching summer,&nbsp; April had its fair share of interesting weather here in Georgia. Much like the annual return of the scorching heat and the pestering pollen, I figured that it would only make sense for me to begin my own tradition as April fades away and May begins to near. As my first month of writing for Deemable comes to a close, I will leave you with some important updates to this month&rsquo;s articles, as I will continue to do so for each month hereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Android vs iPhone" href="//stuff/2011/04/android-continues-to-surge-past-the-apple-iphone/" target="_blank">Android Continues to Surge Past the Apple iPhone</a></p>
<p>Research in Motion (RIM), the maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, announced on Thursday that they were slashing their earnings forecast for the current sales quarter which ends on May 31. For a company whose devices once dominated its market, RIM is losing badly in the war against the Apple iPhone and Android smartphones. RIM&rsquo;s new tablet, the PlayBook, did not fare well after debuting earlier this month. RIM definitely needs to make a transition in its product line, or it may not be &ldquo;in motion&rdquo; for much longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Apple Sues Samsung" href="//stuff/2011/04/copycat-apple-sues-samsung/" target="_blank">Copycat! Apple Sues Samsung</a></p>
<p>An eye for an eye. Samsung, after being sued by Apple over the Galaxy line, filed its own lawsuits against Apple in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In the lawsuit that was filed in the U.S., Samsung says that Apple <a title="Samsung Sues Apple" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/28/samsung_files_additional_iphone_us_suit_against_apple.html" target="_blank">violated patents</a> that ?relate to fundamental innovations that increase mobile device reliability, efficiency, and quality, and improve user interface in mobile handsets and other products.? At this point, the arguments are becoming so broadly generalized that it is almost childish to see these two giants in the tech world sue and countersue over patent infringement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="iSpy" href="//stuff/2011/04/ispy-apple-is-secretly-recording-your-location-history/" target="_blank">iSpy: Apple is Secretly Recording Your Location History</a></p>
<p>After it was announced last week that Apple was secretly recording your location history, both Microsoft and Google-based Android smartphones were also found to be tracking your location history. Google is now facing a $50 million class action lawsuit over concerns relating to the location data. However, Android&rsquo;s location tracking is entirely opt-in by the user and ties a unique ID number to the device&rsquo;s data. Apple released a <a title="apple location tracking" href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/mobile/04/27/apple.location.tracking.statement/index.html" target="_blank">news statement</a> that said, &ldquo;The reason the iPhone stores so much data is a bug we uncovered and  plan to fix shortly. We don&rsquo;t  think the iPhone needs to store more than seven days of this data.&rdquo;&nbsp; Overall though, it really seems like no one cares too much about this invasion of privacy and security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="PlayStation crash" href="//tech/2011/04/playstation-network-goes-down/" target="_blank">PlayStation Network Goes Down</a></p>
<p>Update (4/1) &ndash; PlayStation <a title="Restoration" href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/04/30/press-release-some-playstation-network-and-qriocity-services-to-be-available-this-week/" target="_blank">announces</a> that they will begin to restore several services starting this week.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Network is still down nearly 10 days after the initial outage. During this time, it was found that your personal information and potentially your credit card information was compromised by those who <a title="hackers" href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/04/29/play.station.credit.card/index.html" target="_blank">hacked into the network</a>. The FBI is now working with Sony and users may be compensated for their <a title="subscriptions" href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/04/sony-looking-into-compensating-psn-users-fbi-gets-involved.ars" target="_blank">subscription-based games and services</a>.</p>

<html><body><p style="text-align: left"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/gadgetlab/2010/03/psn.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="309"></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Nazi Zombies, you are free to roam the earth for a little while longer  as Sony&rsquo;s PlayStation Network has been out of service since 4/20.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Network is Sony&rsquo;s equivalent to Xbox LIVE, which allows for PlayStation 3 users to download games, download or stream movies and music, and have access to other services. More importantly, the network serves as the infrastructure for people to connect and play each other in multiplayer games such as Call of Duty. Oddly enough, the  network failure happened to coincide with the release of several  brand  new games including Mortal Kombat, Portal 2, SOCOM 4, and  inFAMOUS 2&rsquo;s beta release. While access to the network is free, content such as Netflix must be paid for by users, leaving them wondering whether they will be reimbursed if the outage lasts any longer.</p>
<p>A little over a year ago, Sony users of the non-slim PS3 had a <a title="similar outage" href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/03/01/latest-info-on-playstation-network-status/" target="_blank">similar outage</a> on their PlayStation Network that was &ldquo;caused by a bug in the clock functionality incorporated in the system.&rdquo; Patrick Seybold, the Senior Director of Corporate Communications &amp; Social Media, posted a message yesterday on Sony&rsquo;s <a title="PSN Blog" href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/04/21/latest-update-on-psn-outage/" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a> that said, &ldquo;While we are investigating the cause of the Network outage, we wanted to  alert you that it may be a full day or two before we&rsquo;re able to get  the&nbsp;service completely back up and running. Thank you very much for your  patience while we work to resolve this matter. Please stay tuned  to&nbsp;this space for more details, and we&rsquo;ll update you again as soon as we  can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While there are an estimated 70 million users on the network worldwide, Sony is unable to clarify how many people are currently affected by the outage. However, players from all over the world have taken their Zombie rage to  popular social media sites like Twitter and Facebook to express their  displeasure with Sony. Got some spare time since you can&rsquo;t own some newbs? Check out some of the tweets found by a quick search of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23PSN" target="_blank">#PSN on Twitter.</a></p>
<p>&ndash; Update 4/23 &ndash;</p>
<p>Patrick Seybold has made <a title="post" href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/04/22/update-on-playstation-network-qriocity-services/" target="_blank">another post</a> on the PlayStation Blog regarding the ongoing issue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;An external intrusion on our system has affected our PlayStation Network  and Qriocity services. In order to conduct a thorough investigation and  to verify the smooth and secure operation of our network services going  forward, we turned off PlayStation Network &amp; Qriocity services on  the evening of Wednesday, April 20th. Providing quality entertainment  services to our customers and partners is our utmost priority. We are  doing all we can to resolve this situation quickly, and we once again  thank you for your patience. We will continue to update you promptly as  we have additional information to share.&rdquo;<a title="Photo" href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/gadgetlab/2010/03/psn.jpg" target="_blank"></a></p>
