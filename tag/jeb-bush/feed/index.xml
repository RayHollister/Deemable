<h2>This Week&rsquo;s Run Down</h2>
<h3>Season 3 of House of Cards leaks out early</h3>
<p>Season 3 of the critically acclaimed Netflix original show House of Cards is scheduled to come out on Feb. 27th, but fans got an accidental sneak peek on Tuesday when the first ten episodes appeared on the streaming TV service early. Netflix quickly pulled it, but those who were already streaming an episode were able to continue to do so as long as they did not stop until the episode ended. Netflix kept a good sense of humor about it, tweeting ?This is Washington. There is always a leak.? Fans can binge on the twisted schemes of the conniving Frank Underwood starting February 27th.</p>

<h3>Jeb Bush accidentally doxes thousands of Floridians</h3>
<p>In his words, &ldquo;In the spirit of transparency,&rdquo; presidential candidate Jeb Bush released emails from when he was governor of Florida. Unfortunately, the sensitive information like Social security numbers, addresses, phone numbers and Credit Card numbers were not redacted from the emails. So, his team basically just accidentally doxed thousands of Floridians.</p>

<h3>Jeb Bush&rsquo;s CTO resigns over controversial tweets</h3>
<p>Chief Technical Officer for Jeb Bush&rsquo;s presidential campaign resigned Tuesday after it came out in the media that Ethan Czahor posted several sexist and racist jokes on Twitter several years ago. He did delete them before starting to work for Bush, but the backlash was apparently too intense.</p>
<p>Kristy Campbell, a spokeswoman for Bush says, &ldquo;While Ethan has apologized for regrettable and insensitive comments, they do not reflect the views of Gov. Bush or his organization and it is appropriate for him to step aside. We wish him the best.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Snapchat selfie leads to first degree murder charge</h3>
<p>A Pennsylvania 16-year-old has been charged with first degree murder after posting a selfie on Snapchat with the dead victim.</p>
<p>Snapchat messages delete themselves after a short period of time, but the person who received the picture saved it before it deleted itself.</p>

<h3>Facebook makes plans for the afterlife</h3>
<p>Facebook has announced new features that allow users to designate a very special Facebook Friend to administer their profile after they die. Before when a Facebook user died there were only two options for their account: permanent deletion or ?memorialization?. Memorialized accounts were frozen in time and could not be accessed, even by immediate family members.</p>
<p>Facebook?s new features will let the ?legacy contact? have SOME control over the memorialized profile. Among other things they will be able to post at the top of the deceased timeline, according to Facebook, ?to announce a memorial service or share a special message.? They can also approve or deny friend requests and update profile pictures.</p>
<p>What they cannot do is access the deceased? private messages. Some secrets, it seems, you take to the grave.</p>
