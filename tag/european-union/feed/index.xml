<h3><a name="h.s5z9zyhhgkjl"></a>Tumblr, Tinder, Wikipedia and Twitter updates</h3>
<p>Tumblr, Tinder, Wikipedia and Twitter have updated their websites and mobile apps.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techspot.com%2Fnews%2F60377-tinder-adds-instagram-friends-friends-more-latest-update.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdmRDaFNoi882TmXS1yx4ZiBepRQ">new Tinder app adds the ability to connect to a cutie using an Instagram account</a>. Now you can swipe pics with a Kelvin filter to the left and Earlybird to the right.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fappleinsider.com%2Farticles%2F15%2F04%2F15%2Ftumblr-wikipedia-overhaul-apps-for-ios-with-new-looks-and-features&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIuyz3tWgwA3-OF8U7QhHhm3kJYQ">new Tumblr app loads GIFs better</a>&nbsp;than ever before. Because that is the only reason why anyone uses Tumblr ? to look at GIFs. And yes, the word is pronounced GIF, it&rsquo;s not peanut butter. I don&rsquo;t care what Steve Wilhite says.</p>
<p>Wikipedia improved the mobile version of its site, making it more readable and better at displaying images.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2F2015%2F04%2Ftwitter-new-homepage%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVeY1tDzvyQ-RbuMBcOpxnQC9TXw">Twitter changed its homepage for users that are not signed in</a>&nbsp;? or just don&rsquo;t have a Twitter account. Now, instead of just seeing a login screen, you&rsquo;ll see several curated channels of tweets. The idea is that you&rsquo;ll get an idea of what Twitter is about, before you even sign up for it.</p>
<h3><a name="h.tdr8udwzbg0p"></a>Game of Thrones Season 5</h3>
<p>On Sunday the fifth season of HBO?s hit show Game of Thrones began, the first four episodes had already leaked online by Saturday evening. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Ftorrentfreak.com%2Ffirst-episodes-of-game-of-thrones-season-5-leak-online-150412%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEP_6ApQsP50Pipmq1zgwwuoZ5N0A">TorrentFreak reports that the first episode was downloaded over 100,000 times</a>&nbsp;within the first three hours after it appeared.</p>
<p>HBO has been making an effort to crack down on sites that are illegally streaming the show, however they don?t seem to be able to do anything about the relatively high quality torrents, which appear to be ripped from watermarked DVD screeners.</p>
<p>Don?t forget, you now have more options for getting your legal Game of Thrones fix thanks to HBO Now?s availability on iOS devices, and to HBO becoming part of Direct TV?s Sling TV app.</p>
<h3><a name="h.phlukuccxr7q"></a>Self-Powered Camera</h3>
<p>Researchers created <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techspot.com%2Fnews%2F60378-researchers-have-created-world-first-self-powered-camera.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2J_hyNUxL5G7tofC5X31dz_G6ZQ">a camera that powers itself</a>. Essentially the camera&rsquo;s light sensors also work as photovoltaic cells creating power. So, this camera could effectively work forever without a battery. The prototype only shoots in 30 x 40 resolution, so it has a lot of room for improvement. The NSA placed an advanced order for twenty pallets once they hit VGA resolution.</p>
<h3><a name="h.ufykkserq7wp"></a>EU accuses Google of abusing search engine dominance by favoring Google Shopping</h3>
<p>The European Union competition regulator announced Wednesday that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Ftech%2F2015%2F04%2F15%2Feu-competition-commission-google-search-abuse-allegation%2F25805885%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqCogcfKMyzLYm_yUYBTVyQW4srA">the EU intends to file antitrust charges against Google</a>. The regulator accuses Google of abusing its dominance of the European search engine market by favoring its own comparison shopping tool over competitors. Google commands over 90% of the search engine market in Europe, while it controls just 67% of it in the US. The EU commission has been investigating Google for five years. Google nearly settled the case last year but the deal fell apart over objections from member countries and rival tech companies. Google responded in a blog post with its defense: more people use its services simply because they are better.</p>
<h3><a name="h.gf3r0nvb1nr"></a>Patent trolls get slayed</h3>
<p>On <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcircanews.com%2Fnews%2Fpatent-trolls-target-podcasts&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZHB355xeRdulEnd2z-4bgrW965A">April 10 the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office invalidated several key claims of a patent</a>&nbsp;that was used to sue several well-known podcasters.</p>
<h3><a name="h.xv0t8owwvl3n"></a>Success Kid helps his dad get a kidney transplant</h3>
<p>Success Kid, the cherubic Jacksonville boy with a fistful of sand, and triumph in his eye, has another success story to add to his r&eacute;sum&eacute;. His dad Justin Griner has been struggling with kidney disease for the past six years. His mom, Laney Griner, recently set up a GoFundMe account to raise money so that Justin could get a kidney transplant. The goal was to raise $75,000, but <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.wjct.org%2Fpost%2Fsuccess-kid-helps-his-dad-raise-money-kidney-transplant&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHEervzlnyVxxEyfAFJhDN0a1o5xA">Laney said she would be happy with anything</a>.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t mention her son Sammy&rsquo;s Internet stardom because she wanted the focus to be on Justin, but the Internet did what the Internet does ? <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Frachelzarrell%2Fthe-real-boy-from-the-success-kid-meme-is-trying-to-get-his%23.aqAVQXWRo&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_q8wmfCp8tlA8YbKPwrclOcLIig">it figured out who that cute kid in the picture was and started telling everybody</a>.</p>
<p>So far, the GoFundMe fundraiser has brought in almost $90,000 and continues to grow.</p>
