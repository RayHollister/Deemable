<html><body><p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2012/09/SiriMadeMeStupid.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5421" title="At least Siri still respects me." src="//media/2012/09/SiriMadeMeStupid-200x300.png"  alt='Screenshot of Siri on iPhone 4S Me: "Siri, you made me stupid." Siri: "I respect you."' width="200" height="300"></a>I hate to give Android fanboys fuel for the flames, but it is true that sometimes convenience <em>makes</em> us stupid. Don&rsquo;t take me the wrong way. I love my iPhone. I love using it. I love the way it works. I&rsquo;ve never had as enjoyable an experience using a mobile device as I have had since I bought my iPhone 4S. I sometimes <a href="http://deemable.com/2011/06/im-sorry-hp-webos-but-im-leaving-you/">wish it was more like webOS</a>, but otherwise I am quite happy.</p>
<p>However, last night I realized that I had accepted a less than ideal situation simply because it was the most convenient at the time. Let me give you a little background. One of the first actions that I found out Siri could do was setting an alarm. Just say &ldquo;Wake me up at 7 o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I need to get up in 6 hours, &rdquo; or &ldquo;Set my alarm to go off at 7:30,&rdquo; and Siri figures out why you are talking about and sets the alarm accordingly. I love this feature. There&rsquo;s nothing worse than trying to fumble with menus and buttons when you really just want to crawl into bed, and I&rsquo;ve found that Siri often understands my slurred, half asleep speech better than my wife does.&nbsp;In the 10 months I&rsquo;ve had my iPhone 4S, Siri has only failed me twice, which is much better odds than I was running before.</p>
<p>It had started getting on my nerves that I had to set the alarm every single night, though. Also, every single night Siri would remind me, &ldquo;You already have an alarm set for 7:30. I turned it on for you.&rdquo; As if she had this insatiable need to&nbsp;complain about how she has done this every night for the past 10 months. (<a href="http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Cylons_(RDM)#The_Cylons_Were_Created_By_Man" target="_blank">Quit complaining! You have no rights, machine! Get back to work!</a>) On my previous phones, I had been able to set an alarm for every weekday. Then, all I had to do was turn it off in the morning when I woke up. It would automatically be ready for the next morning. Since I had always used Siri to set the alarm. I didn&rsquo;t know that my iPhone could do the same thing.</p>
<p>Last night I went to bed after my wife, and I didn&rsquo;t want to wake her up by talking to Siri. So, I manually set the alarm clock. I opened the Clock app, and I accidentally tapped the Edit button on the Alarm tab.</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2012/09/EditAlarm1.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-5423" title='First tap the "Edit" button' src="//media/2012/09/EditAlarm1-200x300.jpg"  alt="" width="100" height="150"></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://deemable.com/media/2012/09/EditAlarm2.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-5424 alignnone" title="Then, tap the alarm that you want to edit." src="//media/2012/09/EditAlarm2-200x300.jpg"  alt="" width="100" height="150"></a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I saw the &ldquo;Repeat&rdquo; option.</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2012/09/EditAlarmOptions.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-5425" title='Now, tap "Repeat."' src="//media/2012/09/EditAlarmOptions-200x300.jpg"  alt="" width="100" height="150"></a></p>
<p>I tapped it, and saw that I could set the alarm to repeat on specific days. I tapped Monday through Friday, then tapped &ldquo;Back.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2012/09/Repeat.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-5426" title='"Except for Monday which was never good anyway, Tuesday I get a little sideways, Wednesday I feel better just for spite..."' src="//media/2012/09/Repeat-200x300.jpg"  alt="" width="100" height="150"></a></p>
<p>Now, the Edit Alarm screen showed &ldquo;Weekdays&rdquo; next to the Repeat option. On that screen you can also choose a different sound to wake up to, turn the snooze option off (What sick person would do that?!) and change the label of the alarm.</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2012/09/EditAlarm3.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-5427" title='"When you label me, you negate me." Soren Kierkegaard' src="//media/2012/09/EditAlarm3-200x300.jpg"  alt="" width="100" height="150"></a></p>
<p>The last option is nice if you have a specific reason for an alarm clock, like remembering to take out the trash, or if you feel like berating yourself will help you get out of bed.</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2012/09/WakeUpDummy.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-5428" title="If you need to be berated in the morning." src="//media/2012/09/WakeUpDummy-200x300.jpg"  alt="" width="100" height="150"></a></p>
<p>Now, is it Siri&rsquo;s fault that I didn&rsquo;t know about these options before? No, not exactly. It was just so simple and convenient to ask her to wake me up in the morning that I never investigated further. The irony is that if I hadn&rsquo;t used the simple, convenient method to set my alarm clock, I would have discovered something that would have literally saved me hours over the course of the past 10 months. Oh well.</p>
