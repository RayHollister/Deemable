After a long run in Miami&rsquo;s blistering summer heat, there were few things I enjoyed more than stepping into a cold shower. That was a long time ago, though. I live in Chicago now, and the aches and pains I have now are less from things like ?running? or ?cycling? and more form things like ?sitting weird? or ?bending down wrong,? and there are few things I enjoy more than stepping into a hot, relaxing shower. It&rsquo;s a bit decadent, I know, but I tend to get lost in thought a bit and end up using a few minutes more water than I know I should. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m alone in that, and neither does Uji, the maker of a clever new LED shower head that&rsquo;s designed to help you enjoy your showers, guilt-free.</p>
