<html><body><p>If you are a small business owner wondering if there are any apps out there that can help make your life easier, wonder no more! These days you can practically run your entire business through a tablet or mobile device. Your device can handle point-of-sale, time tracking, invoicing and much more.<span id="more-9263"></span></p>
<p>Here are a few of our favorite apps for small business owners:</p>
<div id="attachment_9083" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2014/07/paypal_here_hand.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9083" src="/media/2014/07/paypal_here_hand-300x300.jpg"  alt="PayPal, one of the first online transaction companies, got into the mobile payment game with the PayPal Here.

<h3>Point of Sale</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably already familiar with Square, the little plastic card reader that plugs into a smartphone. But Square is no longer the only card reader in town. Here are a few of the card readers currently out there:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://squareup.com/" target="_blank">Square</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/credit-card-reader" target="_blank">PayPal Here</a></li>
<li><a href="http://localregister.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Register</a></li>
<li><a href="http://payments.intuit.com/mobile-credit-card-processing/" target="_blank">Intuit GoPayment</a></li>
</ul><p>You can get all of these for essentially free (for example, the Square reader is $9.99 at retail stores, but it comes with a $10 mail-in rebate). The card reader companies make their money off transaction fees, which vary by device. You can read more about credit cards readers in <a title="Norman asks, ?How can I accept credit card payments using my smartphone??" href="http://deemable.com/2014/07/norman-asks-can-accept-credit-card-payments-using-smartphone/" target="_blank"><strong>this article</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about a different type of cards: business cards.</p>
<h3>Business Card Readers</h3>
<p>There are apps that will allow you to photograph, scan&nbsp;and store the information from people&rsquo;s business cards, creating a digital Rolodex. There are two major apps. Abbyy&rsquo;s is the tried-and-true original, Evernote&rsquo;s is the new upstart:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.abbyy.com/products/bcr/" target="_blank">Abbyy&rsquo;s Business Card Reader</a> ($4.99 on Android and $5.99 on iOS)</li>
<li><a href="https://evernote.com/hello/" target="_blank">Evernote Hello</a> (free)</li>
</ul><h3>Bookkeeping</h3>
<p>A good bookkeeping app will not only connect to your various accounts and allow you to create invoices, but will categorize your expenses and income for tax purposes. There are a number of cool bookkeeping apps out there:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/" target="_blank">Freshbooks</a></li>
<li><a href="http://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank">Quickbooks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bookkeeping.godaddy.com/" target="_blank">GoDaddy Bookkeeping</a> (formerly Outright.com)</li>
</ul><p>Most of these charge monthly or yearly subscription fees. There is also a newcomer called Wave Accounting whose website is free to use. Wave also does payroll management for $4/month for the first 10 employees (and $1/employee after).</p>
<h3>Productivity</h3>
<p>You have two major options for productivity software. The first is Google Drive, which includes Google Docs and Google Sheets. This is free, but not as fully-featured as Microsoft Office. You can also get Microsoft Office 365, the cloud-based (read: online) version of Office. One user is $6/month.</p>
<p>Also, this is not exactly an app but we would be remiss if we didn&rsquo;t mention Google Apps for Work. Do you want to have your own, custom email address that still uses the Gmail interface? Google Apps for Work can give you that. For instance, Ray@SmallBusiness.com could be accessed through Gmail and would also have full access to Google Drive.</p>
<p>Google Apps for Work is $5/user/month or $50/year.</p>

<p><strong>Q: </strong>I&rsquo;m looking at opening a food truck. I&rsquo;ve seen other food trucks and hot dogs stands taking credit cards on their phones. How can I do that? What kind of phone do I have to have, and does it cost a lot of money?<span id="more-9081"></span></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Smartphones have opened up a whole new way for mobile vendors to accept credit card payments. Gone are the days of having to use one of those bulky carbon copy imprinters with hefty fees, high transactions costs and no way to prove if the credit card you were charging was even a real credit card.</p>
<p>You have a few different options that you can choose from, Norman, but the three most popular are Square, PayPal Here and Intuit GoPayment. All three are small devices that plug into the headphone jack of your iPhone or Android phone.</p>

<a href="/media/2014/07/square.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img width="150" height="150" src="/media/2014/07/square-150x150.jpg"  class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="Square pioneered mobile credit card payments with their credit card reader.

<p><strong>Square</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://squareup.com/" target="_blank">Square</a> pioneered mobile credit card processing with their small, square (hence the name) credit card readers. Once you get your Square reader and download and install the free Square Register app, you&rsquo;ll be ready to start accepting credit cards. You can even add your entire inventory to the app, and use it as your point of sale terminal right there on your phone. Transactions you ring up before 5 p.m. are credited to your bank account the following business day. Square charges 2.75% per swipe.</p>
<p><strong>PayPal</strong></p>
<p>PayPal, the company that pioneered online credit card transactions, entered the mobile game a bit later than Square with their credit card reader, a blue triangle known as the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/credit-card-reader" target="_blank">PayPal Here.</a> PayPal Here also offers a point of sale app to go along with the device. Money from real world transactions made using this device is sent directly to your PayPal account. From there the money can be spent online or transferred to your bank account. PayPal Here charges 2.7% per swipe.</p>
<p><strong>Intuit GoPayment</strong></p>
<p>Intuit, the company that makes Quicken account software, makes the <a href="http://payments.intuit.com/mobile-credit-card-processing/" target="_blank">Intuit GoPayment</a> card reader and app. It&rsquo;s about the same shape as a roll of quarters, but a bit shorter. While the GoPayment is physical the biggest one we&rsquo;ve seen, it charges less per transaction than Square or PayPal Here: 2.4% per swipe. The Intuit QuickBooks GoPayment app also integrates with Quicken and many other small business apps.</p>
<p>As the mobile payment industry keeps growing, more and more companies are starting to jump in. Amazon recently debuted&nbsp;a mobile credit card reader. Almost all of the traditional credit card processors like BluePay, Verifone and Chase have also launched their own readers. Even office supply retailer Staples has gotten in on the action.</p>
<p>You have a lot of options to choose from, Norman, and you can get just about all of them for free with no contract. Our advice is that you try all of them until you find the one that fits your needs the best.</p>
