<p>The police of Blackman-Leoni Township, Michigan were more than happy to help a bride keep her wedding costs low by volunteering to take pictures of her in her wedding dress and veil that she will likely never forget. Right after Tammy Lee Hinton&rsquo;s husband slipped the gold ring on her finger, the police greeted her outside City of Zion Ministries church and slipped a pair of steel bracelets on her wrists. </p>
<p>Hinton had been arrested for identity theft two years ago, but slipped out of town to New Port Richey, Florida before her arraignment. When Michigan police found out that she was returning to the area this weekend for her wedding, they took advantage of the opportunity to catch her. However, she was able to make bond and get back to the reception in time to cut the cake with her new husband. No word on whether the cops were invited back for pigs in a blanket.</p>
