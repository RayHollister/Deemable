<h3>A special message from Ray, Tom and Sean</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an avid listener to Deemable Tech, it will probably come as no surprise that we&rsquo;ve been having some difficulty putting out shows for the past few months. The three of us have gone through some major changes in our careers and lives over the past year, and those have taken away a lot of the time we&rsquo;ve had to devote to bringing you this show every week.</p>
<p>So, after months of not recording an episode, we&rsquo;ve made the tough decision to end the Deemable Tech podcast. For now, at least.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come to the realization that it is just not sustainable. We can&rsquo;t keep producing the show to the level that we did before, and it was unfair of us to leave you in the dark about it.</p>
<p>We may relaunch the show down the road, if we are able to.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you are interested in finding out when we or if we do, sign up for our newsletter on the right side of this page.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be the first to know.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t be gone completely, though. You can still catch us answering your tech questions every week on Ask Deemable Tech, so be sure to subscribe to that podcast or listen live Thursdays on 89.9 FM WJCT.</p>
<p>If you have any farewell messages for us, leave us a voicemail at 1-888-972-9868 or send an email to feedback at deemable dot com.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve truly appreciated you listening to (and sometimes even enjoying) our shenanigans for the past four years. It&rsquo;s been a blast.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take this baby for one last ride!</p>

<h3>Google releases Science Journal app</h3>
<p>For those of you who loved doing science projects as a kid, Google recently released a new app that you&rsquo;ll love.</p>
<p>The app, Science Journal, uses the sensors in your phone to measure and record data in real time, including movement, light and sound.</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0.05em; line-height: 1.6875;"><a href="https://makingscience.withgoogle.com/science-journal" target="_blank">As Google says on the Science Journal site</a>, &ldquo;See something you want to measure? How much light is in my room compared to outside? How loud is the dog&rsquo;s bark compared to my cough? Record your observations in real-time at the press of a button. Explore your environment or measure things you&rsquo;ve built yourself.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Among other features, Science Journal lets you record measurements as charts and graphs, and record a voice memo as you&rsquo;re doing your experiment so you can give extra details about it.</p>
<p>Google has also partnered with the Exploratorium in San Francisco to sell special little kits with materials like sensors your phone doesn&rsquo;t have to let you measure other stuff.</p>
<p>Science Journal is currently only available for Android.</p>
<h3>It&rsquo;s all about the qubits, baby</h3>
<p>Verge is reporting that IBM has made <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/4/11589656/ibm-quantum-computing-cloud" target="_blank">a working quantum computer that anyone in the world can play with</a>.</p>
<p>What does that mean? Glad you asked! Basically, as anyone who has watched any movie from the 90s that involved computers can tell you, computers work by translating ones and zeros into machine understandable language and then translating that into human language and user interfaces. Quantum computers use ones, zeros and both at the same time.</p>
<p>Now the question is, what to do with that. We&rsquo;ve built an entire industry out of a binary system, and now that we have the capability to expand it to a trinary or &ldquo;ternary&rdquo; system, the question is how to use it. So, IBM has opened it to the public for research and experimentation because basically the only people who understand what we just said are scientists.</p>
<h3>Google says hello to Allo and Duo</h3>
<p>One area where Google has long lagged behind competitors like Apple and Facebook has been in messaging. Rather than having a single, unified messaging app, Google has introduced numerous messaging systems like Gchat, Google Hangouts, and the default Android text-messaging app.</p>
<p>This week at Google&rsquo;s I/O event, the company announced <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/05/googles-allo-and-duo-are-2-communication-apps-based-on-your-phone-number/" target="_blank">two new messaging apps, Allo and Duo</a>. Allo is for text messaging, and includes Google bot technology which offers up auto-responses to messages based on things you usually type.</p>
<p>Duo, meanwhile, is a 1-on-1 video chat app. It is optimized to work even in low-bandwidth situations.</p>
<p>Both apps support end-to-end encryption, however, controversially, it will not be enabled be default. Some think this might be because it would impede their ability to offer features like the auto response bot.</p>
<h3>All-glass iPhone?</h3>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t do a final episode of the podcast without Ray talking about iPhones, could we?</p>
<p>Forbes is reporting that the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2016/05/20/apple-news-digest-iphone-7-leak-ios-9-3-2-broken/#6d348b86407d" target="_blank">iPhone 8 could lose the unibody aluminium case for an all glass one</a>. No, you didn&rsquo;t read that incorrectly, the next iPhone is the presumptively going to be coined the &ldquo;7&rdquo;, but this rumor is about the iPhone 8.</p>
<p>The glass case is expected to wrap around the entire device and have no bezel as a result.</p>
<p>And apparently the entire front of the phone will be screen. The front facing camera, touch ID sensor, speaker and proximity sensor will somehow all be behind the screen.</p>
<h3>Android apps coming to Chromebooks</h3>
<p>The Google Play Store is coming to Chromebooks. Along with every single Android app!</p>
<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/05/if-you-want-to-run-android-apps-on-chromebooks-youll-need-a-newer-model/" target="_blank">As Ars Technica puts it</a>, everything &ldquo;from Microsoft Word to Hearthstone to Firefox will be able to run on Chrome OS without noticeable performance penalties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the pretty great stuff. Here&rsquo;s the asterisk: Google has released a compatibility list for this amazing new feature and it basically excludes any Chromebook older than two years old. This even includes Google&rsquo;s souped-up and overpriced Pixel Chromebook.</p>

<h3>Apple WWDC&nbsp;2015</h3>
<p>This week Apple&nbsp;held their annual conference to showcase its new software to developers.&nbsp;Since there was so much to talk about, we are just going to focus on the stuff we found really interesting.&nbsp;For full coverage of the announcements made at WWDC 2015, check out <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imore.com%2Feverything-you-need-know-about-wwdc-2015-keynote&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbADMk3MLOvEUxDrItCFevv1crbQ" target="_blank">iMore&rsquo;s article about everything you need to know about they keynote</a>.</p>
<h4>iOS 9 to offer ad blocking</h4>
<p>Apple unveiled the latest version of its mobile operating system this week, and with it comes a host of new features.&nbsp;iOS 9 is going to have ad blocking for the first time ever. Specifically, Safari is going to allow extensions that include the ability to block ads. Publishers that depend on ad revenue to stay in business are super excited about this announcement.</p>
<h4>Six-digit passcodes</h4>
<p>In an effort to make their devices harder to break into, Apple revealed that newer iPhones and iPads that have TouchID and are running iOS 9 will be <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/06/apple-to-require-6-digit-passcodes-on-newer-iphones-ipads-under-ios-9/" target="_blank">required to upgrade from a four-digit passcode to a six-digit one</a>. Passcodes will remain optional, but if you choose to use one you will have to change it to at least six alphanumeric digits.</p>
<p>Another safeguard they introduced: after 10 failed attempts to enter your passcode, your device will erase itself.</p>
<h4>iOS 9 brings multitasking to iPads</h4>
<p>iOS 9 will also introduce a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2015%2F6%2F8%2F8737639%2Fapple-ipad-split-screen-multitasking-wwdc-2015&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGzgPEvtseUymuKYbkwyKGbw5huFg" target="_blank">long-expected feature for iPads: multitasking</a>. This comes in the form of three features, actually, called SlideOver, Splitview and picture-in-picture.</p>
<p>SlideOver will let you quickly slide in another app from a menu on the right side of the screen. For example, you could be using Safari to read restaurant reviews and then slide in Messages to message your friend. Other apps they showed taking advantage of this feature were the Calendar app and Notes.</p>
<p>There will also be a more traditional Split View mode where you can have your screen equally divided up between two apps running simultaneously and independent of each other.</p>
<p>There will also be a picture-in-picture mode that will let you have a small video player on top of other apps. Yes, Apple has finally added a feature all of our TVs had in 1993.</p>
<p>Not all of these features will be available on all devices. The Split View mode will only work on the iPad Air 2. SlideOver and picture-in-picture will be available on late 2013 or newer iPad Airs as well as all iPad Minis.</p>
<h4>iOS 9 brings battery life, performance boost</h4>
<p>Apple says that<a href="http://www.imore.com/ios-9s-performance-boosts-focus-efficiency-and-battery-life" target="_blank"> iOS 9 is all about making the existing hardware run better</a>. They said that they have seen an extra hour of battery life on the iPhone 6, and iOS 9 has a new lower power mode that can save iPhones an additional 3 hours of battery life.</p>
<h4>Apple News</h4>
<p>Apple News is Apple&rsquo;s latest attempt to disrupt a dying industry. This new app will be built into iOS 9, but fortunately it will replace the utterly useless hunk of trash app that was Newsstand. Instead of being what was essentially a folder for news and magazine apps, Apple News is going to be a a news curator app. You&rsquo;ll be able to read Sport Illustrated, the New York Times, Wired and tons of other top tier media and some not so top tier media like local newspapers, TV and radio stations.</p>
<p>According to Apple, the new app learns what you like and suggests similar content. We&rsquo;ll believe that when I see it. The promise of learning content has always been higher than the actual end product.</p>
<p>Apple News can include a lot of interactive features like charts, graphs, videos, and photos. So, it&rsquo;s basically just like Flipboard, except it&rsquo;s built into your iPhone. So, it&rsquo;s going to destroy Flipboard.</p>
<h4>Apple Swift programming language will be open-sourced</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/swift-2-programming-language-will-become-open-source-project-apple">Apple Swift programming language is going to be open-sourced</a>. For the first time ever, developers will be able to create apps for iOS and OS X on a computer that isn&rsquo;t a Mac OS X. Don&rsquo;t get too excited Windows Developers, it only runs on Linux.</p>
<h4>Apple Music</h4>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s &ldquo;one more thing&rdquo; this year was Apple Music. Apple basically took Beats Music, Ping (you guys remember Ping, right?) and the new MySpace (you guys remember MySpace, right?) and stuck them in a Blendtec blender and poured out what was left and called it Apple Music. With Apple Music, you can listen for free to a 24 hour online radio stream called Beats 1, or you can listen to streaming music on-demand for $9.99 for a single membership or $14.99 for a family of up to six. They&rsquo;ll give you a free, three?month trial membership to get you hooked too.</p>
<p>So, yeah, Apple created a Spotify killer. Built into the iPhone and you&rsquo;ll be able to get it on Android too. That&rsquo;s fine, but apparently Apple thinks that you don&rsquo;t have enough social media accounts in your life, and you need one dedicated to communicating with your favorite artists with. You know, just like they thought when they came out with Ping. And it flopped. And, just like Justin Timberlake and the gang thought when they bought MySpace from News Corp and relaunched it as a social media site for musicians, and it? well we don&rsquo;t know what happened to it because we&rsquo;ve never been back for more than enough time to download our pictures and videos. But we&rsquo;ve heard it&rsquo;s a barren wasteland.</p>
<p>On Apple Music, you&rsquo;ll be able to get exclusive content like behind-the-scenes videos, intimate conversations with the artists and musicians can post blogs and updates on Apple Music. You know, just like they can do on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, and their own website.</p>
<h3>Oculus Rift reveals&nbsp;consumer version of virtual reality headset</h3>
<p>Oculus Rift held a major live event this week, <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/9374/oculus-rift-controllers-vr-games-and-software-features-announced">officially unveiling the consumer version of their long-awaited, greatly hyped VR headset</a>. Purportedly light and comfortable, the headset slips on like a baseball cap, is easily adjustable, and allows users to substitute their own headphones for the pair that comes with it. The screen is actually a pair of small, high-res LED screens set right in front of the user?s eyes.</p>
<p>Two controllers were announced. The one that it will ship with? The Xbox One wireless controller. Yep. A slightly more revolutionary controller called the Oculus Touch was also announced: this is a pair of thumbsticks with motion tracking and haptic feedback which the user holds in each hand. The Touch will release in 2016 but is not expected to be available when the Oculus Rift first launches.</p>
<p>Speaking of launching, you are probably wondering when exactly the Rift will launch and how much it will cost. That was one thing the press conference did not shed any light on. The company still says that it is targeting 2016 and there are rumors of a price point around $400.</p>
<h3>Comcast takes away woman&rsquo;s email address, gives it to new customer with the same name</h3>
<p>Cable internet provider Comcast is infamous for their poor customer service, and this next story is not going to help their reputation any. <a href="http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/local/consumer/on-your-side/2015/06/10/put-it-back-the-way-it-was-thats-what-i-want/71031836/">Ken Amaro of First Coast News reports</a> that Comcast took thirteen year veteran customer Kathleen Cox?s email address away and gave it to another customer with the same name who had just signed up in Michigan. Kathleen had used her Comcast email address as her primary email account and when it was taken away lost access to all her emails. She said that it wasn?t until local news took up the story that Comcast finally returned the address to her. No word on whether she got her old emails back as well.</p>
<h3>Google Chrome will start pausing auto-playing Flash videos</h3>
<p>Google says that their next version of Chrome will roll out a feature <a href="http://gizmodo.com/future-versions-of-chrome-will-kill-flash-in-the-name-1709212263">that &ldquo;intelligently pauses&rdquo; Flash content that isn?t central to the web page</a>. This is in the interest of memory and battery life for laptops. By some estimates, disabling Flash while using Chrome on your laptop could give you 10-20% more battery life.</p>
<h3>PornHub crowdfunding sex tape shot in space</h3>
<p>Major porn site PornHub has launched <a href="http://gizmodo.com/pornhub-wants-your-money-to-make-a-porno-in-space-1710530225?utm_campaign=socialflow_gizmodo_facebook&amp;utm_source=gizmodo_facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow" target="_blank">a crowdfunding campaign on IndieGogo to raise money to shoot a sex tape in space</a>. The campaign is looking for $3.4 million in funding which takes into account chartering the flight, insurance, crew, equipment, as well as backer perks. PornHub has not specified who exactly they plan to fly with or the exact date they plan to film on. They do, however, have the actors picked out.</p>
<h3>Facebook payments</h3>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a story we apparently overlooked back in March that recently came to our attention. You can send your friends on Facebook money through Facebook messenger. If you have a debit card on file with Facebook (perhaps you have bought an ad or a dumb game), when you message someone on the Facebook messenger either the app or on the desktop website, you&rsquo;ll see a dollar sign with a circle around it. Click that button and you can send your friends money. Right now it doesn&rsquo;t cost anything to send or receive money via Facebook Messenger. Fortunately, you can set a PIN code for payments so that when you accidently leave your Facebook profile logged in and your friend or girlfriend &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; you, he or she won&rsquo;t be able to transfer all of your money to a new account.</p>
<h3>Reddit bans FatPeople Hate subreddit, throws angry redditors into an uproar</h3>
<p>Reddit, which bills itself as ?the front page of the internet?, and is of course where post the news stories we are working on for this podcast, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/6/11/8767035/fatpeoplehate-reddit-ban">saw some major drama this week</a>. Reddit has long had a policy of allowing people to create subreddits around virtually any topic they want, even when those topics are awful. There are subreddits devoted to racism, bigotry, and all kinds of vile stuff. Reddit generally leaves them alone, unless they start crossing certain lines.</p>
<p>This week, apparently, lines were crossed. Reddit banned five subreddits, the largest of which was one called FatPeopleHate, which boasted over 150,000 subscribers. At the risk of editorializing, FatPeopleHate was actually even worse than it sounded, as redditors there had linked to the Twitter feeds, YouTube channels and personal information of real people, allowing other redditors to pour abuse, bile and mockery on them. FatPeopleHate had also become very popular and was regularly voting threads to the top of reddit?s /r/all, the ?front page? of the internet?s front page.</p>
<p>Reddit said that FatPeopleHate and the other four subreddits had crossed the line by getting involved in harassment instead of just being about ideas. This did not go down well with a very vocal part of reddit?s userbase, who begin creating a flood of alternate subreddits like FatPeopleHate2 and FatterPeopleHate and filling up unrelated subreddits with angry posts about reddit CEO Ellen Pao.</p>
<p>This is not the first time reddit has had problems moderating its own users. There was similar outrage when it tried to crackdown on users posting images from the nude celebrity leaks last year and before that when it attempted to purge subreddits dedicated to ?creepshots?, where men shared sexualized pictures taken of women without their consent.</p>
<p>The problem for reddit is that it doesn?t even require an email address to sign up for the service, and creating a new subreddit is the work of a moment, thus creating a situation that is very difficult to moderate.</p>

<h3>Tesla Announces Software Update for Cars Which Adds &ldquo;Autopilot&rdquo; Feature</h3>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk held a press conference this week at which he announced that late model <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/it-life/tesla-model-s-autopilot-coming-soon-elon-musk-claims-/d/d-id/1319564" target="_blank">Teslas will be getting a software update that will give them a new feature called &lsquo;autopilot</a>.&rsquo; The autopilot feature will bring ordinary Tesla electric cars that much closer to being self-driving, enabling them to stay in their lane on a well-marked highway without driver intervention. Musk claimed that the autopilot technology would enable to a driver to make it from San Francisco to Seattle without steering.</p>
<p>Musk also announced a feature called Range Assurance which will alert Tesla drivers when the charge in their car is getting too low to make it to the nearest charging station.</p>
<h3>$10 Million Target Credit Card Data Breach Settlement Gets Preliminary Approval</h3>
<p>You probably remember the massive data breach that hit Target during the 2013 holiday season where tens of millions of credit cards were stolen right out of their systems. A class action lawsuit was filed and now Target is preparing to settle? for $10 million dollars.</p>
<p>If that amount seems low to you, it is because Target is not going to do the usual thing and send five dollars to every customer whose card number was stolen. Instead, card holders can only be reimbursed if they can show that they were actually hurt by the data breach. They need to have had fraudulent charges placed on their card that they were not reimbursed for, that negatively affected their credit score, or show that they spent a lot of time and money resolving the problem, or that it harmed them in some other way.</p>
<p>The proposed settlement is only preliminary, and members of the class action suit have until November 10th to object.</p>
<h3>RadioShack Puts Customer Data Up for Sale in Bankruptcy Auction</h3>
<p>RadioShack is on the auction block this week as its creditors attempt to sell the company?s assets &ndash; this apparently includes <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2901028/radioshack-puts-customers-personal-data-up-for-sale-in-bankruptcy-auction.html" target="_blank">a large chunk of customer data, including 65 million customer names and physical addresses and 13 million email addresses</a>. Consumer advocates are concerned, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton claims it may be illegal under state law. Texas does not allow companies to violate their own privacy policies and signage in RadioShack promises that they will not sell their private mailing list.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T is also opposing the sale of data because they say RadioShack is not entitled to personal information it collects from wireless sales. AT&amp;T wants the data destroyed to keep it from falling into competitors hands.</p>
<p>A bankruptcy court still has to approve the deal.</p>
<h3>TigerDirect Closing Retail Stores</h3>
<p>Speaking of defunct electronic stores, remember Circuit City&hellip; CompUSA&hellip; Ultimate Electronics? Well, TigerDirect bought them in the late aughts. Well, now <a href="http://jacksonville.com/business/2015-03-24/story/2-tigerdirect-electronics-stores-jacksonville-close" target="_blank">TigerDirect is joining them</a> in the electronic retail store afterlife. <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2015/03/03/brothers-guilty-fraud-at-systemax-computer-company-sent-to-federal-prison-by/" target="_blank">Two of the former executives for TigerDirect were recently sentenced to 60 and 80 months in jail</a> for a kickback scheme that cost the company $27 million. Apparently that hurt the company enough that the company decided to close all by two retail stores.</p>
<p>It makes me sad because TigerDirect was a &ldquo;dot com boom&rdquo; success story. They actually started as a catalog company, but transitioned into internet sales early. When all of the retail computer stores started dying, TigerDirect was holding strong, and they bought up the stores and their IP and entered the retail market. They did a fantastic job of turning stores like CompUSA and Circuit City, which were known for fancy displays and overpriced electronics, into stores with smart employees, simple displays and prices that competed with the Internet.</p>
<p>TigerDirect is going to continue selling computers, electronics and computer components on its website.</p>
<p>No word yet if NewEgg is planning on buying its stores, but that would be the perfect irony.</p>
<h3>Facial Recognition Software Leads To Arrest of Jacksonville Man Who Faked His Own Death</h3>
<p>Another thing the internet has ruined: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/florida-man-initially-thought-dead-arrested-after-facial-recognition-match/" target="_blank">faking your own death</a>. <a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2015-03-23/story/facial-recognition-software-led-feds-jacksonville-businessman-once" target="_blank">Jacksonville businessman Jose Lantigua had been reported dead in Venezuela two years ago</a>. But when he attempted to apply for a new passport under his new, false identity <a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2015-03-23/story/facial-recognition-software-led-feds-jacksonville-businessman-once" target="_blank">the US State Department used facial recognition software to match him</a> to his original identity in their database. Federal agents then set up a sting operation and caught him wearing a brown toupee and ?a poorly dyed beard.?</p>
<p>Lantigua is wanted on numerous counts of insurance fraud, since his family attempted to collect on his life insurance policy after his death. The insurance company has long viewed this with suspicion.</p>
<h3>Google Responds to Reporter with GIF Instead of &ldquo;No Comment&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This week, Daily Dot writer Richard Lewis published a story about <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/esports/youtube-google-esports-livestreaming/" target="_blank">YouTube reportedly planning to relaunch its livestreaming platform with a focus on computer gaming and esports</a>. This is similar to Twitch, which Google tried to buy last year before it ended up being purchased by Amazon.</p>
<p>Lewis reached out to Google for a comment on the reports, and they apparently responded with something only Google could get away with. Instead of the usual &ldquo;no comment,&rdquo; the representative sent Lewis this animated GIF of a little girl shrugging. No text, just the GIF.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://replygif.net/i/855.gif" alt="An animated GIF of a girl shrugging her shoulders." width="500" height="228"></p>
<p>Lewis at first assumed that this was a joke, and said that he received a &ldquo;no comment&rdquo; response from Google in his story. The same representative sent another message saying that the GIF was, in fact, their official response.</p>
<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>Ray shares his thoughts on the <a href="http://cogitowatch.com/" target="_blank">Cogito swartwatch</a> this week.</p>

<html><body><p><b>Q:&nbsp;</b>I&rsquo;m a writer and working on a new blog, where I&rsquo;ll post a new article every week. A friend suggested that I do a weekly podcast, too. How do I do that? What kind of equipment do I need, and how do I market my podcast?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very good at tech terms, so when I looked up this question on the web it just confused me. Is there someone who can walk me through the process and give me a better understanding about podcasts, and blogging in general? I have a &ldquo;computer guy&rdquo; but he doesn&rsquo;t know anything about podcasts.<span id="more-8937"></span></p>
<p><a href="/media/2012/11/WhatIsAPodcast.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright wp-image-6298" src="/media/2012/11/WhatIsAPodcast.png"  alt="What Is A Podcast?" width="280" height="280"></a><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Great question, Karen. Here at Deemable Tech we are actually able to record in a professional studio, but that&rsquo;s not an option for most people. However, you can still record a great podcast right in your own home.</p>
<p>At the bare minimum, you need a computer and a good microphone. If you have nothing but that, you can start recording a podcast. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a Windows or a Mac, both have plenty of software available to do the job. Macs, however,&nbsp;come with the software you need built-in. And, those software programs are a bit easier to use that their PC counterparts.</p>
<p>The kind of microphone you should get&nbsp;depends a lot on your budget, and the amount of time you want to invest in learning about sound production. On the simple end of things, you can get a microphone that plugs into the USB port of your computer for anywhere from 50 to 200 hundred dollars. Most of the major microphone manufacturers make a USB model.</p>
<p>The Audio-Technica AT2020 is one we like, and we&rsquo;ve always had a soft-spot for&nbsp;the Blue Microphone Yeti.</p>
<p>Once you have a good mic, the next step is&nbsp;to record your&nbsp;podcast. You&rsquo;ll&nbsp;need some software to do that. As&nbsp;we&nbsp;mentioned before, on the Mac there is a built-in program to do the job &ndash; it?s called GarageBand. You can also download a free program called Audacity for Windows <em>or</em> Mac. It&nbsp;does a great job recording, and it is pretty easy to use it to edit your recordings.</p>
<p>Once you have your podcast recorded, you are ready to take the big step of putting it out on the internet.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s where it can get nerdy. You&rsquo;ll need to either setup a website that can host an RSS feed, or you&rsquo;ll have to use a service to publish your podcast for you. If your blog is a WordPress site, you can just create a new category named podcast, and then you&rsquo;ll publish all of your podcast episodes in the podcast category. WordPress creates an RSS feed for you, which is the technical term for what a podcast really is. If that sounds too complicated for you, there are services that will set it up for you. One good one is called BuzzSprout. You have to pay for BuzzSprout in addition to your website hosting, but it gets the job done, and it&rsquo;s really easy to set up.</p>
<p>Once you get it published, then you need to advertise it. The best way to advertise it is to get it listed in podcast directories, like the big one,&nbsp;iTunes. It doesn&rsquo;t cost anything to be listed in iTunes, but you practically <em>have</em> to be listedthere if you are ever going to be heard. More people listen to podcasts listed on iTunes than anywhere else. But there are other great podcast services like Stitcher and Slacker Radio as well. List your podcast in as many places as possible.</p>
<p>Hopefully that will get you pointed in the right direction, Karen.&nbsp;Another great resource to getting a podcast started is, ironically, a podcast.&nbsp;Download the Podcast app for iPhone or iPod or just open iTunes and search for Podcasting for Dummies. This is the companion podcast for the book Podcasting for Dummies. There&rsquo;s a lot of great information in the podcast, and it&rsquo;s completely free.</p>
<p>Check that out and you&rsquo;ll be on your way to internet stardom in no time.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>
<p>TOM: From WJCT studios in Jacksonville, Florida, I&rsquo;m Tom Braun, in for Ray Hollister,</p>
<p>ELIZABETH: I&rsquo;m Elizabeth Pampalone, in for Tom Braun</p>
<p>TOM: and this is Deemable Tech. This week&rsquo;s episode is brought to you by A Small Orange, Homegrown Hosting. A refreshingly different approach to web hosting. On the web at a small orange dot com.</p>
<p>ELIZABETH: Got a question about your computer, smart phone, tablet or the Internet? You can give us a call us at One Eight Eight Eight, Nine Seven Two, Nine Eight Six Eight, or send us an email at questions@deemable.com.</p>
<p>TOM: Well, as you can tell, Ray is not here again this week. Thankfully this time it&rsquo;s not because he&rsquo;s having an appendectomy like a few weeks ago. This time it&rsquo;s actually because of something great: Ray and his wife just had their second child!</p>
<p>So congratulations to Ray! He&rsquo;ll be back soon. And thank you Elizabeth for stepping in to help us out this week.</p>
<p>ELIZABETH: Happy to be here!</p>
<p>TOM: And also back again this week is our producer Sean Birch.</p>
<p>SEAN: Hello there!</p>
<p>TOM: And as we said on last week&rsquo;s show, we&rsquo;re changing things up a little bit here on the podcast. We realized that the people who listen to this and the people who listen to our segments on public radio aren&rsquo;t necessarily the same.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a specific plan just yet, but we do know that we won&rsquo;t be spending as much time answering questions on the podcast. We&rsquo;re still going to answer them, it just won&rsquo;t be as many. Instead we&rsquo;re going to try different things. And if you have suggestions for things you?d like to hear us try, let us know. Questions@deemable.com.</p>
<p>Before we dive into questions and other stuff, I got a call from a friend today with an interesting problem. Interesting to me, anyway, not so good for her.</p>
<p>She followed a page that had posted a story about a cat who had gotten lost and finally come home to its owners after six months. And she had posted a comment along the lines of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to let cats outside.&rdquo; Now that&rsquo;s a statement that you can agree or disagree with, but she posted it in a really non-confrontational way. Just a statement of opinion.</p>
<p>But some people who she didn&rsquo;t know who were not Facebook friends of hers started replying to this comment and saying really mean things. They were calling her names, saying she should be neutered, that she shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed out of the house, etc. And she was getting notifications about these comments. So she called me in a real tizzy wanting to make the notifications stop.</p>
<p>Basically, this is Facebook bullying. What are some steps my friend could take to stop it?</p>

Ray and Tom are both back in the studio following almost a month of holidays, illnesses and no shows. After catching up and making sure everyone is feeling better (spoilers: they are!), they&rsquo;re joined by producer Sean Birch to play a round of geeky trivia we&rsquo;re calling DOES NOT COMPUTE.</p>
<p>Then all three review some new tech gadgets, including the bug bite itch relief instrument Therapik, the Jabra HALO2 Bluetooth headphones and the Lifeproof Fre iPad Mini case.</p>

<p>TRANSCRIPT</p>
<p>RAY: From WJCT studios in Jacksonville, Florida, I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister,</p>
<p>TOM: I&rsquo;m Tom Braun,</p>
<p>RAY: and this is Deemable Tech. The Deemable Tech Podcast is brought to you by A Small Orange, Homegrown Hosting. A refreshingly different approach to web hosting. On the web at a small orange dot com.</p>
<p>TOM: Got a question about your computer, smart phone, tablet or the Internet? You can give us a call us at One Eight Eight Eight, Nine Seven Two, Nine Eight Six Eight, or send us an email to questions@deemable.com.</p>
<p>TOM: Well we?re back after quite a long break. Let?s address the elephant in the room. Ray, what happened?</p>
<p>RAY: Well, I had major surgery!</p>
<p>TOM: Today on the show we?re changing things up a little.</p>
<p>RAY: Right, we are going to be doing fewer questions. We?ve realized that the people who listen to our podcast and the people that listen to our radio segments on NPR are not necessarily the same people.</p>
<p>TOM: With all due respect to any radio listeners out there, the typical podcast listener is a little more tech savvy. And we want to make this podcast more interesting for you guys. We don?t have a specific plan. Instead we?re going to try different things. And if you have suggestions for things you?d like to hear us try, let us know. Questions@deemable.com.</p>
<p>RAY: Well, later on in the show, we have some cool tech products to review, but before we jump into that, what do we have on the docket first, Tom.</p>
<p>TOM: We?ve come up with a segment called DOES NOT COMPUTE. I?ve compiled some quiz-show style questions about tech facts, things that the average user may not know. I?m going to ask Ray joined by our producer Sean Birch some of these questions and we?ll see how they do.</p>
<p>Where did the word robot originate from?</p>
<p>Ken Olsen, the founder of DEC, said in 1977, ?There?s no reason for any individual to have a ____ in their home.?</p>
<p>What is the only sport played on the moon?</p>
<p>In a vacuum light travels at 670 and a half million MPH. Harvard scientists recently used slowed a beam of light down to what speed?</p>
<p>How many bytes are there in a kilobyte?</p>

<html><body><p><a href="/media/2013/08/DJShottGreenLightShow.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7803" alt="DJ Shott Green Light Show" src="/media/2013/08/DJShottGreenLightShow-300x165.png"  width="300" height="165"></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">On this episode of Deemable Tech, Ray and Tom finally get a question they&rsquo;re not qualified to answer: How do you make a podcast?! Sound ridiculous? Most podcasts are not recorded in an amazing studio like WJCT&rsquo;s, and most podcasts do not have incredible producers like Sean Birch. In other words, Ray and Tom have no credible experience in producing a real podcast! So, Ray invited DJ Shott, host of <a href="http://greenlightshow.com/">The Green Light Show</a>, a comedy podcast recorded in Jacksonville, to come to the studio to talk about what it&rsquo;s like to really produce a podcast. A word of warning, The Green Light Show is a very explicit comedy podcast that holds nothing back. So, if you get offended at the Comedy Zone, The Green Light Show probably isn&rsquo;t for you. But if you like comedy that gets really raunchy, check out The Green Light Show, and subscribe to <a href="http://greenlightshow.com/itunes">The Green Light Show in iTunes</a>. However, no need for a warning about this episode. Ray, Tom&nbsp;and DJ were perfect gentlemen, and refrained from any potty language during the show.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After they talked about podcasting, Ray and Tom asked DJ about his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=nike%20fuelband&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Anike%20fuelband&amp;sprefix=nike%20fuel%20ban%2Caps%2C449&amp;tag=deemtech-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps" target="_blank">Nike+ FuelBand</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=deemtech-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0"> and got his take on it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After the break, Ray and Tom recapped what DJ talked about. Ray mentioned a website where you can easily create a podcast, but he couldn&rsquo;t remember the name of the site. The site is <a title="BuzzSprout - Create and publish your own podcast. " href="http://www.buzzsprout.com/?ref=Deemable" target="_blank">BuzzSprout</a>. If you aren&rsquo;t tech savvy but you want&nbsp;to start a podcast, BuzzSprout is a great resource. You can try it out for free to find out if you like the service, and it&rsquo;s free forever. If you decide to upgrade, paid plans start at only $12 per month.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, Ray and Tom answered questions about printing contacts from Outlook, email file attachments that cause the Internet to disconnect, and how to block pop-ups on Internet Explorer and Chrome.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don&rsquo;t forget, we&rsquo;re still in the middle of the $50 Amazon Gift Card giveaway! If Deemable Tech gets at least 500 subscribers on iTunes and at least 200 subscribers on YouTube by the end of August, we are going to give away an Amazon Gift Card worth $50!</p>

<p dir="ltr">TOM: Hey Ray, I just wanted to tell you that you look great tonight.</p>
<p dir="ltr">RAY: Thanks Tom, you don&rsquo;t look too bad yourself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: Ray, we&rsquo;ve often been complimented that we really have faces for radio. And to commemorate that, we&rsquo;ve entered ourselves into Folio Weekly&rsquo;s yearly Best of Jax contest under the Hottest Local Celebrity category. Because, listeners, we know that when you think of Hot Local Celebrities you think of Ray and Tom.</p>
<p dir="ltr">RAY: <a href="http://folioweekly.com/bestofjax">folioweekly.com/bestofjax</a>&nbsp;*blah blah blah*</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: Alright, Ray, should we answer some listeners questions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">RAY: I think we should.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: OK, let&rsquo;s take a look at Carlos&rsquo; question.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: Carlos writes:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hey Ray and Tom,</p>
<p dir="ltr">I&rsquo;d really like to start a podcast, but I have no idea where to begin. Would I have to buy studio time? Don&rsquo;t some people podcast out of their house? What kind of equipment would I need to do it that way? Thanks, love your show! Carlos</p>
<p dir="ltr">RAY: You know what Tom? I think we have found a question that we are not qualified to answer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: Why is that Ray? We do a podcast almost every week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">RAY: Well, Deemable Tech is really not like most podcasts. Most podcasts aren&rsquo;t recorded at radio stations. So, we&rsquo;ve invited somebody who has experience doing a podcast the real way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Joining us in the studio we have DJ Shott, the host of the Green Light Show.</p>
<ul><li>Describe your show to us. What is your podcast about?</li>
<li>Why did you want to start a podcast?</li>
<li>How did you get started podcasting?</li>
<li>Where do you record and stream your show from?</li>

</ul><p>Next question:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Marvin writes, I have an HP computer &nbsp;with Windows XP.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I have been trying&nbsp;to print my contact list alphabetically from Outlook. The left half of the page prints out, but the &nbsp;right half is hidden and will not print. It is laborious to have to &nbsp;click on an individual&rsquo;s name to get the whole address, etc.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is frustrating, because I want to print out a hard copy to keep by my desk so I do not want to have to have the computer turned on.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any ideas?&nbsp;Thanks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: Hi Marvin, thanks for the question.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first thing I would do is check your printer settings when you are printing. Just before you click the print button that prints the actual page you should see the screen where you select what printer you want to print with. While you&rsquo;re on this screen you can make changes to the print settings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What this screen looks like and what options it gives you depend on a lot of different factors: what operating system you&rsquo;re running, what kind of printer you have, what program you&rsquo;re launching from, etc. There should be a button on this screen for printer preferences or advanced settings. Click that, and then look for an option that says something like ?Fit to page? or ?Fit to paper size? or ?Shrink to fit?. Most printers have a setting like this which will automatically resize a page that is too big to fit on the paper. You may have to click a different tab to find it. Just look around, you won&rsquo;t hurt anything!</p>
<p>Once you find ?Fit to page?, select it. Then click the OK button to get back to the print screen. Now go ahead and print. Hopefully the right side of the page is no longer cut off!</p>
<p dir="ltr">RAY: Cool. So, that solves the problem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: Wait, there&rsquo;s one more thing Marvin may need to know about and it&rsquo;s kind of a doozy. If he has Outlook 2003, it actually prints using Internet Explorer. So he needs to go into an entirely different program to change his settings!</p>
<p dir="ltr">RAY: Wow, that&rsquo;s convenient.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: Yeah. So Marvin, if you have Outlook 2003, open up Internet Explorer, go to Internet Explorer, then select ?Page Setup? from the File menu. There you should find the Shrink to fit option. Check it, and boom. Happy printing!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richard writes, When I try to attach an attachment to an email, Internet Explorer looses connection to the Internet. I am using Windows 7 with latest patches applied by Window&rsquo;s Update and IE 10. This email attachment problem happens on my Gmail and a friend&rsquo;s yahoo mail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: Thanks for letting us know what versions of Windows and Internet Explorer you are using, Richard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on what you&rsquo;re describing, my first guess is that your copy of Internet Explorer has an add-on that is being a little too helpful. Possibly you have a security or anti-virus add-on such as Norton that&rsquo;s malfunctioning and interfering with uploading files. To be on the safe side, start by disabling all the add-ons in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You can do this by clicking on the settings menu and then going to Manage Add Ons and disabling them one by one. But if you have a lot of them it&rsquo;s quicker to click on the Tools menu and then under ?Toolbars&rsquo; you should see an option that says ?Disable Add Ons&rsquo;. Click on that to bring up the dialogue box that will allow you to do that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once you&rsquo;ve done that you will need to reboot your computer. When it comes back up, open up Internet Explorer and see if you are able to add attachments in Gmail now. If you are, you can start enabling add ons one by one through the manage add-on menu until you figure out which one was causing the problem. Or just leave them all off.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Again, if you have something like Norton Anti-virus it&rsquo;s a good bet that it&rsquo;s add ons are causing the problem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If this doesn&rsquo;t resolve your problem, well&hellip; try a different browser? You know, Chrome is looking very nice this time of year&hellip;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bill writes, Question: I just read your response to Christine&rsquo;s question about browsers in April, and have a follow-up question. Is there any way to completely block pop-up ads while running Chrome or IE? Or is Firefox&rsquo;s add-in the only solution? On both Chrome and IE, I have adjusted the settings to block pop-ups but that doesn&rsquo;t stop them on many sites I visit. I realize that those annoying ads are paying for these otherwise free websites, but I have to wonder what&rsquo;s the point of blocking pop-ups when so many get through anyway, slowing down the page loading to the point that it reminds me of being on dial-up.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thanks!</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: Excellent question, Bill. You turn on the pop-up blocker and you still get pop ups! What&rsquo;s up with that?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The thing you have to understand is that pop-up blocking is an arms race. Just like you can&rsquo;t tell your computer to block all viruses, you can&rsquo;t really tell it to block all pop-ups. Every time there&rsquo;s some new advance in pop-up blocker technology, the people making the pop up ads just get smarter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">RAY: To make things even harder on the makers of pop up blockers, you can&rsquo;t just block all pop ups everywhere. there are lots of legitimate pop ups people want to see. Blocking all pop ups would make too many sites non-functional.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So the ?block pop ups&rsquo; options in Internet Explorer and Chrome walk a fine line.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TOM: If you&rsquo;re really serious about blocking pop-ups in Internet Explorer or Chrome you need to download an add-in or extension that does so, much like you did for Firefox. On Chrome, check out <a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/chrome">Adblock Plus</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-pop-up-blocker/nmpeeekfhbmikbdhlpjbfmnpgcbeggic?hl=en">Better Pop-up Blocker</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your options are more limited on Internet Explorer, but there&rsquo;s an add on called <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Smart-Popup-Blocker/3000-7786_4-10282837.html">Smart Pop-up Blocker</a> that will block most pop-ups. It&rsquo;s no 100%, but it&rsquo;s the best we could find.</p>
<p dir="ltr">RAY: Just a friendly little PSA about pop-up blocking: many free websites are ad supported. When you visit your favorite site and you&rsquo;ve got a pop-up blocker running, you may have avoided seeing that annoying pop-up ad but you&rsquo;ve also cost that site some ad revenue. So be sure to deploy your pop-up blocker judiciously. Most pop-up blockers give you the ability to allow pop-ups for certain sites. Be sure to allow them for sites you want to support!</p>
