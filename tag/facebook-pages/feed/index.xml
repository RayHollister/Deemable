<p>Facebook just sent out an email to Facebook Page administrators letting them know about some much needed upgrades. Some of the new features coming to Facebook Pages are similar to the recent Facebook profile redesign. &nbsp;These upgrades are going to make Facebook Pages much more flexible and interactive.&nbsp;According to the email, on March 10th all Facebook Pages will have receive the following new features:<span id="more-263"></span></p>
<ul><li>&ldquo;Notifications when fans interact with your page or posts,</li>
<li>A place to showcase photos along the top of your page</li>
<li>A news feed for your page</li>
<li>The ability to Like and post on other pages as your page&rdquo;</li>
</ul><p>These are features that have been lacking from Facebook Pages for many years, causing some businesses and groups to forgo creating a Facebook Page all together and instead creating an individual profile for their organization.</p>
<p>One of the ways that Facebook differentiated itself when it was founded in 2004&nbsp;from the other social networks that were available at the time was by making it exclusive to Harvard students. They, then expanded the site to allow to other Ivy League schools to join. After they had reached almost all Ivy League schools, they opened the site to other colleges and then finally to the general public. Because of the way they controlled who could create a profile on the site, they prevented the service from being inandated with the companies and garage bands that diluted the experience at other social networks like MySpace.</p>
<p>Hopefully, these changes will help businesses and organizations to interact with their customers and members, while allowing Facebook to keep the methodical and clean user experience that it has become known for. Although all Facebook Pages will receive the upgrade on March 10th, the email explains that administrators can go to their Page now and preview &nbsp;the new design, and they can choose to upgrade their Page early.</p>
