<html><body><p>BlackBerry Messenger, BBM, which was previously thought to be BlackBerry&rsquo;s life preserver may now be being chopped off and sold as a separate company. This isn&rsquo;t surprising since <a href="http://deemable.com/2013/01/episode-25-single-handedly-fixing-new-years-resolutions-and-2013-tech-predictions/" title="I called it back in January. The end is near for BlackBerry.">BlackBerry has been in a slow death-spiral for the past couple of years</a>. While bringing BlackBerry Messenger to other platforms like Android, Windows Phone and the iPhone might be great for consumers, it happening this late in the game is another sign of BlackBerry&rsquo;s imminent demise. However, offering BBM for sale may only be to increase the perceived value of Blackberry as a whole before a sale of the entire company. For more on this story, here is Landon Robinson&rsquo;s story from BestTechie.com.</p>

<html><body><p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/253/0/c/the_promised_land_by_drcrawford-d2x3a60.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="215"></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The dog days of summer have arrived. June 21st marked the first official day of summer, when&nbsp;the Earth&rsquo;s semi-axis in the Northern Hemisphere reached its maximum incline tilt&nbsp;of 23&deg; 26&prime;&nbsp;towards the sun &ndash; the Summer Solstice. With the basketball season over now, the only thing to keep us sports fans occupied is baseball, beer, and barbecues &ndash; but hey, I&rsquo;m not complaining about that. So take a break from counting down the minutes until your weekend starts and let&rsquo;s reflect on what&rsquo;s happened over the last month in the tech world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="RIM" href="http://deemable.com/stuff/2011/06/the-downfall-of-research-in-motion/" target="_blank">The Downfall of Research in Motion</a></p>
<p>Oh, how the mighty have fallen! The former king of the smartphone industry, RIM, is dying at a rapid rate&hellip; and employees and stockholders alike are making it known to the world. Yesterday, a high-level RIM employee sent an <a title="RIM employee" href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/06/30/open-letter-to-blackberry-bosses-senior-rim-exec-tells-all-as-company-crumbles-around-him/" target="_blank">anonymous open letter</a> to the RIM Senior Management Team that ripped the company apart. RIM, on the defensive, responded by issuing <a title="RIM response" href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/06/30/rim-responds-to-open-letter-published-by-bgr/" target="_blank">its own statement</a> to the public concerning the letter. In the end though, Research in Motion is freefalling and investors are clamoring for a <a title="Showdown" href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-07-01/rim-averts-showdown-in-agreement-to-study-chairman-role-change.html" target="_blank">top-down restructuring</a> of the company, but really, can anyone save BlackBerry?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Apple" href="http://deemable.com/tech/2011/06/the-future-of-apple/" target="_blank">The Future of Apple</a></p>
<p>OS X <em>Lion</em> is nearing a public launch for July, after&nbsp;Apple &ldquo;seeded the golden master version of OS X Lion to developers&rdquo; earlier today. &ldquo;OS X Lion brings many innovations from iOS including home screens (called Launchpad in Lion), autosaving, full screen application interfaces, and auto resume in apps. This is in addition to native support for the Mac App Store, Mission Control, an&nbsp;all new email client, built-in FaceTime, and interface and feature &nbsp;improvements through out the operating system. Lion also includes&nbsp;AirDrop file sharing,&nbsp;multi-user remote computer access, and&nbsp;Find my Mac (through iCloud).&rdquo; &ndash; Source: <a title="9to5" href="http://9to5mac.com/2011/07/01/os-x-lion-golden-master-seeded-to-developers/" target="_blank">9to5Mac</a></p>
<p>Apple has done significantly well this quarter, and it is estimated that users of the iOS platform alone generates roughly <a title="Per user iOS Revenue" href="http://www.asymco.com/2011/06/30/how-much-is-an-ios-user-worth-to-apple-about-150-every-year/" target="_blank">$150 of revenue a year</a> per account (not including the cost of the actual iOS device). The iPhone, however, has a ton of competition these days and the <a title="Galaxy S II" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-photos-2011-6" target="_blank">biggest threat</a> may be the Samsung Galaxy S II &ndash; the follow-up to one of the most popular Android phones, the Galaxy S.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="LulzSec" href="http://deemable.com/tech/2011/06/lulzsec-hackers-attacking-the-internet/" target="_blank">&ldquo;LulzSec&rdquo; Hackers: Attacking the Internet</a></p>
<p>After hacking the CIA, PBS, and numerous other web sites,&nbsp;it looks like LulzSec&rsquo;s run of terror has finally come to an end. The group announced on multiple web sites that it would be <a title="LulzSec Disbanding" href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/web/06/26/tech.lulzsec.hackers/index.html?iref=allsearch" target="_blank">disbanding</a> on Monday, but did not provide any particular reason for the decision. For 50 days LulzSec hacked and terrorized corporations and governments for the sake of humor, and hopefully this is the last we hear of their exploits.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><img class="alignleft" src="http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/259/6/1/research_in_motion_by_darkscher-d2yudz9.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="239"></p>
<p>We may soon be saying R-I-P to R-I-M, the maker of the once beloved BlackBerry smartphone. After reducing their initial profit forecast roughly two months ago, Research in Motion announced its first quarter financial earnings results yesterday which were almost $1 billion lower than expected. Although RIM managed to ship 13.2 million BlackBerry devices and 500,000 BlackBerry Playbook tablets during the quarter, the discouraging news of the drop in profit and revenue caused shares in the company to fall 14 percent in after-hours trading last night. Now, Research in Motion is going to cut costs through &ldquo;headcount reductions&rdquo;&hellip; meaning&nbsp;<a title="layoffs" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/research-in-motion-layoffs-2011-6#ixzz1PY1c9sNe" target="_blank">layoffs are on the way</a>.</p>
<p>RIM is quickly fading into oblivion behind the new giants in the business &ndash; Apple&rsquo;s iOS and Google&rsquo;s Android. Jarislowsky Fraser Ltd., Research in Motion&rsquo;s sixth-largest investor, just revealed that it would be dumping all of its 10.2 million shares in the company, with the chairman of the investment group leaving this <a title="Quote" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/rims-sixth-biggest-investor-dumps-stake-2011-6" target="_blank">ominous quote</a>,&rdquo;&nbsp;We are on the way out. The stake has been reduced by more than 50% or even more&hellip; They are resting on their laurels &hellip; Steve Jobs is a much better marketer than RIM.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So what is RIM&rsquo;s main problem? Delays in production&hellip; and the fact that their technology is not keeping up with competitors&rsquo;. No new products will be released by the company during the summer until August, the latest BlackBerry <a title="update" href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/rims-conundrum-convincing-you-to-buy-a-blackberry-70-device/50934" target="_blank">OS 7.0 update</a> coming out won&rsquo;t even work for most of the current models, and who honestly wants to buy a <a title="PlayBook" href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/223562/four_reasons_to_avoid_the_blackberry_playbook.html" target="_blank">PlayBook</a> over another tablet?</p>
<p>Co-CEO Jim Balsillie announced in a <a title="RIM" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Research-In-Motion-Reports-ccn-2426498309.html?x=0&amp;.v=1" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiscal 2012 has gotten off to a challenging start. The slowdown we saw in the first quarter is continuing into Q2, and delays in new product introductions into the very late part of August is leading to a lower than expected outlook in the second quarter&hellip; RIM&rsquo;s business is profitable and remains solid overall with growing market share in numerous markets around the world and a strong balance sheet with almost $3 billion in cash. We believe that with the new products scheduled for launch in the next few months and realigning our cost structure, RIM will see strong profit growth in the latter part of fiscal 2012.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With investors&rsquo; confidence already shaken, this statement does not provide much reassurance, and the outlook is looking very grim for&nbsp;a company that was once considered the world leader in the smartphone market.</p>

<p>From tornadoes and thundering superstorms, to the dry, blistering heat of the approaching summer,&nbsp; April had its fair share of interesting weather here in Georgia. Much like the annual return of the scorching heat and the pestering pollen, I figured that it would only make sense for me to begin my own tradition as April fades away and May begins to near. As my first month of writing for Deemable comes to a close, I will leave you with some important updates to this month&rsquo;s articles, as I will continue to do so for each month hereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Android vs iPhone" href="http://deemable.com/stuff/2011/04/android-continues-to-surge-past-the-apple-iphone/" target="_blank">Android Continues to Surge Past the Apple iPhone</a></p>
<p>Research in Motion (RIM), the maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, announced on Thursday that they were slashing their earnings forecast for the current sales quarter which ends on May 31. For a company whose devices once dominated its market, RIM is losing badly in the war against the Apple iPhone and Android smartphones. RIM&rsquo;s new tablet, the PlayBook, did not fare well after debuting earlier this month. RIM definitely needs to make a transition in its product line, or it may not be &ldquo;in motion&rdquo; for much longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="Apple Sues Samsung" href="http://deemable.com/stuff/2011/04/copycat-apple-sues-samsung/" target="_blank">Copycat! Apple Sues Samsung</a></p>
<p>An eye for an eye. Samsung, after being sued by Apple over the Galaxy line, filed its own lawsuits against Apple in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In the lawsuit that was filed in the U.S., Samsung says that Apple <a title="Samsung Sues Apple" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/28/samsung_files_additional_iphone_us_suit_against_apple.html" target="_blank">violated patents</a> that ?relate to fundamental innovations that increase mobile device reliability, efficiency, and quality, and improve user interface in mobile handsets and other products.? At this point, the arguments are becoming so broadly generalized that it is almost childish to see these two giants in the tech world sue and countersue over patent infringement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="iSpy" href="http://deemable.com/stuff/2011/04/ispy-apple-is-secretly-recording-your-location-history/" target="_blank">iSpy: Apple is Secretly Recording Your Location History</a></p>
<p>After it was announced last week that Apple was secretly recording your location history, both Microsoft and Google-based Android smartphones were also found to be tracking your location history. Google is now facing a $50 million class action lawsuit over concerns relating to the location data. However, Android&rsquo;s location tracking is entirely opt-in by the user and ties a unique ID number to the device&rsquo;s data. Apple released a <a title="apple location tracking" href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/mobile/04/27/apple.location.tracking.statement/index.html" target="_blank">news statement</a> that said, &ldquo;The reason the iPhone stores so much data is a bug we uncovered and  plan to fix shortly. We don&rsquo;t  think the iPhone needs to store more than seven days of this data.&rdquo;&nbsp; Overall though, it really seems like no one cares too much about this invasion of privacy and security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="PlayStation crash" href="http://deemable.com/tech/2011/04/playstation-network-goes-down/" target="_blank">PlayStation Network Goes Down</a></p>
<p>Update (4/1) &ndash; PlayStation <a title="Restoration" href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/04/30/press-release-some-playstation-network-and-qriocity-services-to-be-available-this-week/" target="_blank">announces</a> that they will begin to restore several services starting this week.</p>
<p>The PlayStation Network is still down nearly 10 days after the initial outage. During this time, it was found that your personal information and potentially your credit card information was compromised by those who <a title="hackers" href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/04/29/play.station.credit.card/index.html" target="_blank">hacked into the network</a>. The FBI is now working with Sony and users may be compensated for their <a title="subscriptions" href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/04/sony-looking-into-compensating-psn-users-fbi-gets-involved.ars" target="_blank">subscription-based games and services</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more about the ongoing PSN issues on their official blog:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/4d99f3d3ccd1d5196c0e0000/sai-chart-android-iphone-ios-market-share-ipod-touch.gif" alt="" width="610" height="457"></p>
<p>Google continues to take a bite out of the big Apple. After dethroning both RIM (BlackBerry) and the Apple iPhone in the middle of 2010, Google&rsquo;s Android mobile operating system continues to increase its grip on the smartphone market with a growth of 7% since last November. With over 1/3 of the market share, the Android platform is really growing into the vision that Google and the Open Handset Alliance sought to develop, when they collaborated to create a modified version of the Linux kernel for mobile devices. The open-source software stack has a large community of developers, both paid and those who choose to develop on their own free time, who have combined to write over 150,000 apps for the Android Market, many of which are available for free. Google even introduced a live, online Android Market that can be accessed via computer, where Android smartphone users can download apps directly to their phone from the convenience of their computer.</p>
<p>One downside to Android&rsquo;s continual growth is that the platform is still heavily fragmented, with multiple phone manufacturers running multiple different firmwares, leading to developers having issues streamlining apps and wondering whether their apps will even work on future versions of Android. In order to combat this fragmentation, Google has taken the initiative by gaining total control of the Android platform, even going as far as to create non-fragmentation clauses that would give Google final veto rights. What this means for developers and smartphone users in the future though is uncertain, after all, Google promised to keep Android open-source&hellip;but that didn&rsquo;t last for long.</p>
