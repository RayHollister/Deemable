<h3><b>Taylor Swift makes Apple change its mind about paying artists during free trial period of Apple Music</b></h3>
<p><b> </b>In an abrupt about-face, Apple has changed course and decided to <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/apple-music-backs-down-will-804050?utm" target="_blank">pay artists during the free trial period of Apple Music streaming</a>.</p>
<p>Apple executive Eddie Cue specifically attributed this change of heart to an open letter penned to the company by Taylor Swift, in which she said that she would not be making her album &ldquo;1989&rdquo; available on the streaming service because she felt they were not compensating artists fairly. Since Apple&rsquo;s announcement, several indie labels have announced that they were signing up with Apple Music.</p>

<h3><b>Gmail officially adds &ldquo;Undo Send&rdquo; feature</b></h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever sent an email and realized that you didn&rsquo;t attach an attachment &mdash; or worse, wrote something you never meant to say to the other person &mdash; Gmail added a feature this week that you will love: <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gmail-officially-adds-undo-send-turn-it-on-right-now-1713353235">Undo Send!</a></p>
<p>Well, maybe &ldquo;Undo Send&rdquo; is a bit of a misnomer. What the feature really does is delay sending your message for 5, 10, 20 or 30 seconds to give you the chance to change your mind.&nbsp;Just turn on &ldquo;Undo Send&rdquo; in your Gmail settings, and the next time you send something you didn&rsquo;t mean to you can just hit the &ldquo;undo&rdquo; button at the top of the page.</p>
<p>The team at Gmail has actually been experimenting with this feature for the past six years (and you could use it before now, if you knew that it existed and knew how their Google Labs section works), but they officially made it part of their mail service this week.</p>
<p>We should note that this appears to only work for personal Gmail accounts at the moment. So if your employer uses Gmail for your work email, you still need to be cautious about what you send for the time being.</p>
<h3><b>Disney and ABC TV cancel plans to offshore IT jobs</b></h3>
<p>Back in October, Disney gave notice to around 250 IT employees that work for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. To make it worse, they thought they were being called in to find out they were getting bonuses.</p>
<p>Actually, no, it gets worse than that, they then found out that they were being &ldquo;given the opportunity&rdquo; to work longer if they stuck around and trained their replacements. The controversial part was their replacements were foreigners in the country on H-1B Visas. The purpose of the H-1B visas was to attract IT workers to the US to fill the gaps in tech labor shortages, not to replace American workers with lower wage earning employees.</p>
<p>Some <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2915904/it-outsourcing/fury-rises-at-disney-over-use-of-foreign-workers.html">media outlets mentioned it</a>, but it really picked up steam when a few weeks ago, Disney&rsquo;s ABC Television Group called in about 35 application developers for a meeting, and told them they were being laid off, and they were going to be training their replacements, more foreign employees on H-1B visas.</p>
<p>However, just last week, Disney did a complete about-face, and canceled the layoffs. Of course, no one would speak to the media on the record, but <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2934978/it-outsourcing/in-a-turnabout-disney-abc-tv-cancels-plans-to-outsource-it-jobs.html">an anonymous source told Computerworld</a> that Disney just &ldquo;want[s] this to go away &mdash; right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A source at Disney also told Computerworld that this change had absolutely nothing to do with the dozens of negative news stories that popped up after the news got out.</p>
<h3><b>You can get Windows 10 for free, but there&rsquo;s a catch</b></h3>
<p>Since Windows 10 was first announced, Microsoft has released a lot of conflicting statements about who exactly would be able to get it free. From the beginning they&rsquo;ve been consistent in saying Windows 10 will be a free upgrade to users who have Windows 7 and Windows 8 and 8.1. But for other users, things have been less clear.</p>
<p>First they said that even users without legitimate copies of Windows would be able to upgrade, then they said they wouldn&rsquo;t. Then this week there was more confusion. It appeared that Microsoft would be giving away a free copy of Windows 10 to any user who agreed to test it. However it now appears that <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/22/windows-10-licensing-explained-beta/" target="_blank">the situation is more complicated than that.</a></p>
<p>Installing the Windows 10 preview <i>will </i>grant users free access to Windows 10, but only as long as they stay in the preview program. If they leave at any point, their preview copy will eventually expire. In other words, you can get Windows free as long as you agree to beta test new releases of the operating system&hellip; forever.</p>
<h3><b>Facebook working on facial recognition software that doesn&rsquo;t need to see your face</b></h3>
<p>Facebook researchers say they are working on experimental systems that will allow Facebook to recognize users in photos <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/06/facebooks-facial-recognition-will-one-day-find-you-even-while-facing-away/" target="_blank">based off their hairstyle and clothing</a>. In other words, it is facial recognition that doesn&rsquo;t actually need to see your face.</p>
<p>According to the researchers, the new system is accurate 83 percent of the time, far better than current facial recognition systems which need clear, full frontal shots of people&rsquo;s faces to recognize them. The researchers described the project as &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; and &ldquo;long term&rdquo; and said that we shouldn&rsquo;t expect it to be rolled out on the site any time soon.</p>
<p>Good thing, considering the controversies that Facebook&rsquo;s facial recognition algorithms have caused in the past.</p>
<h3><b>The Navy says Windows XP is worth $9 million</b></h3>
<p>According to Computerworld, <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2939435/government-it/us-navy-paid-millions-to-stay-on-windows-xp.html">the U.S. Navy has about 100,000 computers</a> running Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Office 2003 and Exchange 2003. Server 2003 expires in July, and all of the others have been expired. To keep their computers running in tip-top shape with security updates, the Navy is paying Microsoft $9.1 million.</p>
<p>If there was ever a computer you wanted to be secure, it would be a computer in the Navy.</p>
<p>And, to be fair to the Navy, Windows XP still has approximately 10-14 percent market share, depending on who&rsquo;s counting, which, either way, still puts it over Apple&rsquo;s OS X.</p>
<h3><b>Ebay and Amazon banning confederate flag merchandise</b></h3>
<p>Major online retailers, including Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba are <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/06/ebay-bans-confederate-battle-flag-other-items-bearing-racist-icon/" target="_blank">banning and removing Confederate flag merchandise from their inventories</a> in the wake of the tragic shooting at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The man the police have identified as the shooter, Dylann Roof, had posed in several photographs with a Confederate flag. As calls have spread for the flag to be removed from state flags and capitals, retailers have been quick to distance themselves from it publicly.</p>
<p>Actually getting flag merchandise off the shelf may take time, however. As of the time when we recorded this episode, however, some confederate flag merchandise was still available.</p>
<h3><b>Microsoft Office coming to Android</b></h3>
<p>Microsoft released <a href="http://time.com/3934630/microsoft-office-android-apps/" target="_blank">full versions of its Office productivity apps (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) for the Android operation system</a> this week.</p>
<p>This comes after about month of beta versions of these apps being available for Android users. Microsoft said in a statement that the incorporated a lot of feedback from users of these early versions into the final ones.</p>
<p>These apps won&rsquo;t work on all Android devices, especially older ones, but they will work on a majority of smartphones and tablets. The Microsoft Office mobile apps are currently free in the Google Play store.</p>
<h3><b>Amazon now paying Kindle Unlimited authors by the page</b></h3>
<p>Amazon has announced that starting on July 1, they will begin paying authors in the Kindle Unlimited and Kindle Lending Library programs <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/amazon-publishing-authors-payment-writing/396269/" target="_blank">by the number of pages read, rather than simply when their book is downloaded</a>. To keep the system from being gamed by large fonts, Amazon has introduced the Kindle Edition Normalized Page Count, or KENPC, which is a formula that will attempt to standardize page counts for all books.<br>

When I try to email them to myself it shrinks the video. I&rsquo;ve been told to just connect my phone to my computer and download them that way, but how?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you need to do Ellen. Fire up your computer, grab the charging cable for your iPhone and plug one end into your iPhone and the other end into your computer. Only one end will fit the iPhone, and the other end is the obvious end you&rsquo;ll plug into the PC.</p>
<div id="attachment_9745" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/USBtoLightningAnd30-PinCable.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-9745 size-medium" src="//media/2015/02/USBtoLightningAnd30-PinCable-300x243.jpg"  alt="USB to Lightning Cable And USB to 30-Pin Cable" width="300" height="243"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">With this easy to follow guide, you too can plug your iPhone into your computer.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the first time you have plugged your iPhone into your computer, you&rsquo;ll&nbsp;see a pop up indicating that the software for the device is being installed.</p>
<div id="attachment_9747" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/Shot01.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9747" src="//media/2015/02/Shot01-300x98.png"  alt="Without the device driver software, the two pieces of hardware cannot communicate." width="300" height="98"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Without the device driver software, the two pieces of hardware cannot communicate.</p></div>
<p>Right after you plug in your iPhone, (or after the driver software is done installing) you&rsquo;ll get a notification on your phone that asks if you should trust this computer. Tap <strong>Trust</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_9746" style="width: 179px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/IMG_3576.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9746" src="//media/2015/02/IMG_3576-169x300.png"  alt="Trust is an important part of any relationship, especially the one between a smartphone and a computer." width="169" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Trust is an important part of any relationship, especially the one between a smartphone and a computer.</p></div>
<p>You&nbsp;may see&nbsp;a similar window appear on your computer. Click <strong>Continue.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_9748" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/Shot02.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9748" src="//media/2015/02/Shot02-300x123.png"  alt="Trust is a two-way street." width="300" height="123"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Trust is a two-way street.</p></div>
<p>Then, if you&rsquo;re using a Windows PC, you should get a pop up window on the computer that basically is asking &ldquo;What do you want to do with this?&rdquo; It will literally say &ldquo;AutoPlay&rdquo; and give you options to choose from. Click&nbsp;&ldquo;<strong>Import Pictures and Videos.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_9749" style="width: 305px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/Shot03.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9749" src="//media/2015/02/Shot03-295x300.png"  alt="So, uh, what do you wanna do with this here thing, eh?" width="295" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">So, uh, what do you wanna do with this here thing, eh?</p></div>
<p>All of your pictures and videos will be selected. You can make changes to how and where they are imported by&nbsp;clicking Import Settings.</p>
<div id="attachment_9750" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/Shot04.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9750" src="//media/2015/02/Shot04-300x153.png"  alt="Import pictures and videos? That sounds exactly like what I wanted to do!" width="300" height="153"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Import pictures and videos? That sounds exactly like what I wanted to do!</p></div>
<p>On the Import Settings Menu, you can choose to send the images and videos to different folders, change the file name of the photos and videos, and other options. Click <strong>OK</strong> to keep your changes.</p>
<div id="attachment_9751" style="width: 275px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/Shot04-1.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9751" src="//media/2015/02/Shot04-1-265x300.png"  alt="Lots of choices. Where do you want what to go? Don't feel like making choices? Just click OK." width="265" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lots of choices. Where do you want what to go? Don&rsquo;t feel like making choices? Afraid of succumbing to analysis paralysis? Just click <strong>Cancel,</strong> and get out of there.</p></div>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve chosen which videos and pictures you want to import, then click&nbsp;<strong>Import</strong>. Your images and videos will begin to transfer to your computer. Depending on how many pictures you have, this may happen quickly, or it may take a while.</p>
<div id="attachment_9752" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/Shot04-2.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9752" src="//media/2015/02/Shot04-2-300x157.png"  alt="You'll watch your life flash before your eyes ? if you took a picture of every moment of your life." width="300" height="157"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You&rsquo;ll watch your life flash before your eyes ? if you took a picture of every moment of your life.</p></div>
<p>You&rsquo;ll see a checkbox that says, &ldquo;erase after importing.&rdquo;&nbsp;We recommend not checking it.&nbsp;If there is a problem transferring the video, then the video is gone. It&rsquo;s best to wait&nbsp;until you you?ve confirmed that the video is transferred, and then delete it from your iPhone manually.</p>
<div id="attachment_9754" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/Shot05.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9754" src="//media/2015/02/Shot05-300x199.png"  alt="Finally!

<p>Another window will open up showing all of your pictures and videos that you just imported.</p>
<p>If for some reason you don&rsquo;t get a pop-up, click the <strong>Start button</strong> and select &ldquo;<strong>Computer</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/Shot06.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9755" src="//media/2015/02/Shot06-287x300.png"  alt="Click the Start button and then click Computer" width="287" height="300"></a></p>
<p>Then, you&rsquo;ll right-click the iPhone icon, and select &ldquo;<strong>Import Pictures and Videos</strong>.&rdquo; From there, you&rsquo;ll do everything else the same as we said before.</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/Shot07.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9756" src="//media/2015/02/Shot07-300x248.png"  alt="Right-click to get the Import Pictures and Videos menu" width="300" height="248"></a></p>
<p>If you are using a Mac it starts out the same: plug the iPhone in and tell it to trust the computer.</p>
<p>Then, you&rsquo;ll need to open the application Image Capture or <span data-scaytid="2" data-scayt_word="iPhoto">iPhoto</span>. We&nbsp;prefer Image Capture because you can choose where the video is stored on your hard drive.</p>

<p>Once Image Capture is open, at the bottom of the window, you can select which folder to import them to.</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-25-at-8.41.19-PM.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9758 size-medium" src="//media/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-25-at-8.41.19-PM-300x189.png"  alt="Image Capture" width="300" height="189"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can choose the obvious places like Pictures or Documents, or you can decide to save them where ever you want to.</p>
<div id="attachment_9759" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-25-at-8.41.42-PM.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9759" src="//media/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-25-at-8.41.42-PM-300x200.png"  alt="You could even choose to import your pictures and videos to iPhoto, but no one really knows why you would want to do that." width="300" height="200"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You could even choose to import your pictures and videos to iPhoto, but no one really knows why you would want to do that.</p></div>

<html><body><p><script id="prx-p118375-embed" src="http://www.prx.org/p/118375/embed.js?size=small"></script></p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>I heard you talking about Windows XP expiring. I don&rsquo;t want to go to Windows 8, and I can&rsquo;t find any new Windows 7 computers to buy. What do I do?<span id="more-8795"></span></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>We&rsquo;ve been talking about this a lot lately because <a title="Support for Windows XP is Ending Soon" href="http://deemable.com/2014/03/support-windows-xp-ending-soon/">Microsoft officially stopped supporting Windows XP on April 8, 2014</a>. This means that, while you can continue using XP on your computer, Microsoft will no longer be doing anything to keep it up to date. There won&rsquo;t be any new security updates or patches to keep hackers from finding new ways to break into the operating system. If you decide to stick with Windows XP, Microsoft is basically saying that you are now on your own. They recommend upgrading to Windows 8 instead.</p>
<div id="attachment_8796" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2014/05/win_8_start_screen.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8796" src="//media/2014/05/win_8_start_screen-300x216.jpg"  alt="The Start Screen in Windows 8 received a lukewarm response from some users. Image credit: Microsoft" width="300" height="216"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Start Screen in Windows 8 received a lukewarm response from some users.<br>Image credit: Microsoft</p></div>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t say why you&rsquo;re not interested in Windows 8, James, but we&rsquo;re going to guess that it may have something to do with its user interface. Microsoft decided to completely get rid of the classic Start Menu with Windows 8, and replaced it with a Start Screen that was unlike anything else on the market. This made a lot of people unhappy because it was not what they were used to. It even made some people literally sick to their stomachs from motion sickness because the Start Screen slides from left to right while you&rsquo;re using it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re happy to report that Windows 8.1, the latest version, is much better in this respect. They&rsquo;ve brought back the Start Button, and you can reduce the motion features associated with the Start Screen. According to rumors, Microsoft may just return to the classic Start Menu in the next version of Windows.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, James, you really can?t afford to wait for that to happen. And you&rsquo;re not likely to find a new computer with Windows 7 on it because Microsoft no longer sells the rights to manufacturers to install it on new computers.</p>
<p>If you really want to go to Windows 7, you can still purchase copies of it from third party vendors like Amazon.com, NewEgg or TigerDirect, and install it yourself. This isn&rsquo;t very difficult if you are just upgrading your old Windows XP machine. Just stick the disc in the drive and follow the instructions. Microsoft has gone to considerable lengths in the last few years to make Windows upgrades easy.</p>
<p>However, things get a little tricky if you&rsquo;re looking to install Windows 7 on a new computer with Windows 8 already on it. To do this, you&rsquo;ll have to completely remove Windows 8 from your computer first, which means formatting your hard drive and starting from scratch. This can be intimidating, so we recommend paying your friendly neighborhood computer guy to do it for you. He can probably get Windows 7 safely installed in an hour or two, and you&rsquo;ll have some peace of mind knowing that it&rsquo;s been done right.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s estimated that nearly 500 million people around the world use the Windows XP operating system on their computers. If you&rsquo;re one of those people, you need to be aware of an important change from Microsoft.<span id="more-8622"></span></p>

<p>On April 8, 2014, the software giant ended&nbsp;their support for Windows XP. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that your computer suddenly stopped working on April 9. It will, however, start to be a lot riskier to keep using.</p>
<p>Windows XP was released in 2001, and because of its worldwide popularity Microsoft has continued to support it with updates, bug fixes and security patches for the past 13 years. As the company begins to focus on newer versions of the Windows operating system, they&rsquo;ve decided to stop releasing these updated security patches for XP. This means that there will be nothing to guard you from hackers finding new ways to break into computers running XP and stealing personal information from victims.</p>
<p>Now, the chances are that your copy of Windows XP will still be relatively secure on April 9, but that will change as it gets older and older. To protect yourself, we recommend that you upgrade your operating system. Microsoft, of course, is happy to help, and have created&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-support-help" data-cke-saved-href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-support-help">a page with all of the information you&rsquo;ll need to know</a>. There, you can download a program that will check your PC to see if it is compatible with Windows 8.1, the latest version of Windows.</p>
<p>You may have heard about Windows 8 getting a bad rap due to a new interface and the fact that initial versions didn&rsquo;t include the classic Start Menu so many of us know and love. But the truth is that you can still run the classic Windows desktop in Windows 8, which looks and feels a lot like what you&rsquo;re used to.</p>
<p>We should note that upgrading to a new operating system will cost money, and that an upgrade to Windows 8.1 costs $199. That&rsquo;s a lot, and that&rsquo;s the reason most people buy a new computer with Windows already installed on it. In fact, you can get a new Windows 8 computer for as low as $249.</p>
<p>If those options sound too pricey or if you&rsquo;re just not ready for Windows 8, we recommend checking out Windows 7. Microsoft has stopped selling it officially, but you can still buy copies of the home version from many third party vendors like Best Buy and Amazon.com for around $100. It is a great operating system, and we would go as far as to say it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;new&rdquo; Windows XP in terms of it being easy to pick up and use.</p>
<p>Whatever you decide to do, you need to start taking steps to update that old copy of Windows XP right now. Having an outdated, unsecured operating system might cost you more than any new one ever could.</p>

<html><body><p>Mary Beth says the text on her email is too small. Is there an easy way to change the text size so it&rsquo;s easier to read? The hosts of Deemable Tech, Ray Hollister and Tom Braun, help her out in this week&rsquo;s Ask Deemable Tech.</p>
<p><script id="prx-p91009-embed" src="http://www.prx.org/p/91009/embed.js?size=full"></script></p>
<p>RAY: Hi, I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister, </p>
<p>TOM: I&rsquo;m Tom Braun, </p>
<p>and we&rsquo;re the hosts of Deemable Tech. On the show, we answer your questions about computers, tablets, mobile phones and the Internet, like this question: </p>
<p>TOM: Mary Beth writes: Yesterday at work, when I came back from lunch, I opened my email and all of a sudden my emails were super tiny. I tried to find a menu or button to change the view, but I couldn&rsquo;t find anything. I&rsquo;m using Outlook 2003 on Windows XP. Help! The text is so small I can barely read it.</p>
<p>RAY: Thanks for your question, Mary Beth. That has to be frustrating! My best guess is that you might have slipped on the wheel button on your mouse? Do you remember what you had for lunch that day? Maybe your fingers were greasy?</p>
<p>TOM: All right Ray, quit picking on her eating habits, you don&rsquo;t even know this woman! Yeesh! </p>
<p>RAY: OK, OK. Well, Mary Beth, here&rsquo;s why that might have happened. In Outlook 2003, the only way to change the font size in the body of an email you receive is to click on the body of the email, then hold down Ctrl on your keyboard, while you scroll the mouse wheel button up and down. Roll it up to make it larger, and roll it down to make it smaller. Play with it and just keeping rolling the button up and down until you find a size that is comfortable for you.</p>
<p>TOM: The neat thing is, this trick also works in a lot of web browsers, like Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox. So, if something you&rsquo;re reading on the web is too small, or too big, just hold down the CTRL button and roll the mouse wheel button up and down until you find a size that is easier to read. You can do this on a lot of laptops also. Some laptops have specific areas of the touchpad that are designated for scrolling, and they&rsquo;ll usually be marked with arrows. Others will scroll if you use two fingers on the touchpad. Whichever way your laptop scrolls, just hold down the control button while you do it, and it will make the text size larger and smaller. </p>
<p>RAY: And this trick works in a lot of other applications other than just Outlook and Internet Explorer. Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint were just a few of the programs that we were able to find that this trick works in as well. </p>
<p>Another thing is, if you try holding down the CTRL button and rolling the mouse wheel button up and down and it doesn&rsquo;t work, or you&rsquo;re not able to make it large enough to read comfortably, check your screen resolution. Right-click on your desktop when everything else is closed or minimized, and then click Properties and Settings. You&rsquo;ll see a slide bar under the heading Screen Resolution. Moving that slider and clicking &ldquo;Apply? will change the how big everything is on your screen. Generally, the &ldquo;native? setting, or the one that will look the best, is the one that is farthest to the right, but move it around until you find a setting that you like and is comfortable for your eyes. </p>
<p>TOM: So, that&rsquo;s two things you can try, Mary Beth. One of them will definitely fix the problem. Try zooming the text size by holding down the CTRL button and rolling the mouse button up and down, and then if that doesn&rsquo;t work, right-click your desktop and then click Properties and Settings, and change your Screen Resolution. </p>
