<p>Unless you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock, you know by now that the world&rsquo;s  most wanted international terrorist, Osama bin Laden, was killed in his  million-dollar compound in Pakistan on the 1st of May. Suspected as the mastermind  behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and the  Pentagon, news of bin Laden&rsquo;s death signaled a time for Americans to  rejoice and to celebrate what we have been longing for &ndash; <em>justice</em>.</p>
<p>The military&rsquo;s elite special forces group who killed bin Laden, unofficially called SEAL Team 6, deserves all the credit that they have received for executing their mission to perfection. Upon confirming bin Laden&rsquo;s death, the black ops kill team even grabbed all the electronic material they could find as they hurriedly exited the Abbottabad compound, including dozens of computers, flash drives, and disks. This electronic material was given to a special team of military intelligence operatives and members of the CIA to be analyzed as quickly as possible so that any information <a title="information" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42881728/ns/world_news-death_of_bin_laden/?GT1=43001" target="_blank">can be used</a> while it remains pertinent. SEAL Team 6 and all of the troops fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq must be praised, whether you agree or disagree with our country&rsquo;s military actions, but none of this would have been remotely possible without the use of technology.</p>
<p>From the <a title="tapped phone" href="http://gizmodo.com/#!5797990/it-took-one-tapped-phone-call-to-lead-osamas-courier-to-him" target="_blank">tapped phone call</a> of Osama&rsquo;s courier that led the US military directly to the front steps of his compound, to the use of satellites in order to <a title="satellites" href="http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/05/02/6571688-how-satellites-helped-get-osama" target="_blank">map the operation</a>, to the live video feed of the mission <a title="video feed" href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/web/05/02/bin.laden.video/index.html" target="_blank">sent over 7,000 miles to the President</a> and his advisors, and from the use of sophisticated biometric tools <a title="Forensics" href="http://gizmodo.com/#!5798039/csi-bin-laden-commandos-use-thumb-eye-scans-to-track-terrorists" target="_blank">used to identify the body</a>, there have been remarkable advancements in technology since the tragedy that occurred nearly 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Not only has technology helped locate and identify America&rsquo;s (former) Most Wanted, it helped spread the news of Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s death like wildfire. Many of you found out through popular social media outlets or by mobile device long before President Obama delivered his address to the nation. News of bin Laden&rsquo;s death even set a <a title="record" href="https://twitter.com/#!/twitterglobalpr" target="_blank">Twitter record</a> for the highest sustained rate of tweets ever, with an average of 3,440 Tweets per second from 10:45PM-12:30AM. As for myself, I found out through a friend harmlessly checking his cell phone during a break in a late night session of doubles tennis. The Internet, however, has its downsides as well: It seems like every mistake you make could be put out there for the world to see&hellip; just ask Fox40 News.</p>
