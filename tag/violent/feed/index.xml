<p>On Monday, the U.S.&nbsp;Supreme Court ruled&nbsp;in a 7-to-2 <a title="Majority Opinion" href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/08-1448.pdf" target="_blank">majority opinion</a> against a California law that banned the sale of violent video games to children in the case&nbsp;<em>Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association</em>.&nbsp;The majority opinion, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, says that&nbsp;video games &ldquo;qualify for First Amendment protection. Like protected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through familiar literary devices and features distinctive to the medium.&rdquo; The First Amendment essentially provides those protected by the U.S. Constitution with the right to freedom of expression, and in this instance, video games are a way to communicate ideas.</p>
<p>The California law would have prohibited the sale or rental of violent video games to minors under the age of 18, with violent video games defined as &ldquo;killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being.&rdquo; Retailers who violated the act would have been fined up to $1,000 per infraction. The video game law was originally signed by then-California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in October of 2005 but was <a title="blocked" href="http://news.cnet.com/Judge-blocks-California-video-game-law/2100-1043_3-6005835.html" target="_blank">blocked by a federal judge</a>, whose decision was upheld by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The state of California appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn those decisions in May of 2009.</p>
<p>Justices Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer dissented from the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling. Thomas said that the view at the time when the Bill of Rights was originally amended&nbsp;&ldquo;does not include a right to speak to minors (or a right of minors to access speech) without going through the minors&rsquo; parents or guardians,&rdquo; and Breyer wrote,&nbsp;&ldquo;California&rsquo;s law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression. The statute prevents no one from playing a video game, it prevents no adult from buying a video game, and it prevents no child or adolescent from obtaining a game provided a parent is willing to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruling, however, is a huge win for the video game industry which makes $10.5 billion in domestic annual sales. The computer and video game industry are represented by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) in the United States, with&nbsp;members including Disney Interactive Studios, Electronic Arts, Microsoft Corp, and Sony Computer Entertainment America.&nbsp;Michael D. Gallagher, the president and CEO of the ESA stated,&nbsp;&ldquo;Today, the Supreme Court affirmed what we have always known&ndash;that free speech protections apply every bit as much to video games as they do to other forms of creative expression like books, movies and music&hellip; The Court declared forcefully that content-based restrictions on games are unconstitutional; and that parents, not government bureaucrats, have the right to decide what is appropriate for their children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision will most likely put an end to all the expensive litigation by individual states to ban the sale of violent video games to minors, and undoubtedly put a smile on the faces of children who have been patiently waiting to kill some nazi zombies.</p>
