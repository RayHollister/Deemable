<html><body><p>If you&rsquo;re like us, you probably got a shiny new smartphone or tablet&nbsp;for the holidays. Here are our tips for keeping that device looking brand new, and few ideas for what you can do with your old one.<span id="more-9453"></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protect Your New Device</span></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_9504" style="width: 255px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2014/12/iphone_otterbox.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-9504" src="//media/2014/12/iphone_otterbox-183x300.jpg"  alt="An iPhone 4 in an Otterbox Impact case. Image credit: gisuser / Flickr" width="245" height="400"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An iPhone 4 in an Otterbox Impact case. Image credit: gisuser / Flickr</p></div>
<p>The first thing you should do with your new device&nbsp;is put a case on it. We can&rsquo;t stress how important this is. It breaks our hearts to see people with gadgets that came out not even a month ago, and they&rsquo;ve already broken the screen.</p>
<p>There are a ton of different kinds of cases out there. If you&rsquo;re really concerned about protecting your device, we recommend a hefty case&nbsp;from companies like Otterbox, Lifeproof or Griffin. Both brands offer cases that are rated for protecting against drops from normal heights and have material to keep your screen&nbsp;scratch-free. Some of them even claim to be waterproof.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to hide your fancy new smartphone or tablet, a number of companies sell thin, clear plastic cases. These will not offer the same level of protection as an Otterbox case, but they will be better than nothing. Look around online or head to pretty much any store that sells electronics to find one that best fits your needs.</p>
<p>If you decide not to get a case (or even if you do), you should seriously consider buying an extended warranty for your device.&nbsp;For most electronics, we don&rsquo;t feel like extended warranties are worth the money. However, they are a godsend for smartphones, especially if they cover accidents</p>
<p>Whether you get an extended warranty or not, take the time right now to figure out how long your warranty will last. A year is pretty standard for a new smartphone, but be sure to double check. It also helps to mark that date on your calendar or set a reminder. If your device starts acting funny, you can make sure&nbsp;to get it taken care of before that timer runs out.</p>
<p>With a good warranty, the device maker will often send you a new one before you mail back your old one so that you don&rsquo;t have to be device-less&nbsp;for any longer than necessary.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What to Do With Your Old One</span></b></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not planning to keep your old smartphone or tablet as a backup or for archival purposes, you should consider selling it or recycling it.</p>
<p>To get the best price, you&rsquo;ll want to sell it on Craigslist or eBay. The downside to Craigslist is that you have to meet strangers from the internet in real-life. The downside the eBay is that you have to go to Post Office or the UPS store. You can try searching through other auctions and online for a good idea of how much your device is worth in the condition it is in.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you have a fairly new gadget like an iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy 4, you could also check out places like Amazon and Gazelle. They will buy your phone online and pay you fast.&nbsp;Or you can&nbsp;trade in your iPhone at the Apple Store, Best Buy, Game Stop and Target. You won&rsquo;t get as much selling your iPhone or Android phone to the big companies, but you&rsquo;ll get rid of it fast and get your money fast.&nbsp;So, if convenience is what matters to you, that&rsquo;s the route we would go.</p>
<p>If you have a smartphone that you think is too old to sell, or you just want to do something nice for others, there are a lot of charitable organizations that can make good use of your old device.</p>
<p>If your phone can at least still make phone calls, you can drop it off at any Verizon Wireless store and they will get it into the hands of someone who needs it. Through their program&nbsp;HopeLine, they collect phones and give them to victims of domestic abuse.</p>
<p>If your phone is completely dead, there are charities that accept electronics that can recycle them and get money to go towards their efforts. As always, make sure that you trust the charity you are giving to.</p>
<p>Also, many cities have e-waste recycling centers for computers and other electronics. Try looking on your city&rsquo;s website to see if there is one near you.</p>
<p>No matter what you decide to do with your old device, you need to make sure you wipe its memory and reset it to factory default if possible. The last thing you want is for your personal information to fall into the wrong hands. Your device should have come with instructions on how to reset it. We&rsquo;ve got full details on how to do it for iPhones, iPads and Android phones in <a title="Trent asks, ?How do I wipe my smartphone??" href="http://deemable.com/2014/07/trent-asks-wipe-smartphone/" target="_blank"><strong>this article</strong></a>.</p>

<html><body><p>The <del>only</del>&nbsp;<em>most</em> interesting thing announced at the <a title="The iPhone 5 is here! Whoopidy Doo! | Deemable Tech" href="http://deemable.com/2012/09/the-iphone-5-is-here-whoopidy-doo/">Apple special announcement</a>&nbsp;last week was the new Apple EarPods. Apple has redesigned the earbud headsets that have come standard with every iPod and iPhone since they were released in 2001. I picked up a pair and unboxed them for your viewing pleasure below.</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="752" height="453" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2uRTvMzHQU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
<p>The EarPods look strange, alien and futuristic when you look at them in the package, but after you try them in your ears, the design makes perfect sense. They are substantially more comfortable than the classic Apple earbuds. They don&rsquo;t fit into my ears perfectly, but after all, these aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;custom molded to my ears like a pair of&nbsp;<a title="Logitech Ultimate Ears" href="http://ultimateears.logitech.com/en-us">Logitech Ultimate Ears</a>. These also aren&rsquo;t $170 to $1999 either! However, these were designed to comfortably fit as many people as possible, and you can tell when you put them in your ear. Instead of being a big, round globes that you have to wedge into your ears, they are an angular orbs that gently fit into the natural shape of your ear. The EarPods also have multiple sound ports instead of one large metal mesh screen. The multiple sound ports allow the airflow in your ear to occur more naturally and allow for a resonating chamber for the lower range of notes.</p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2012/09/EarPods1.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5548" title="Brand New Set of Apple EarPods. I'm not going to open them until I get home. I'm not going to open them until I get home. " src="//media/2012/09/EarPods1-225x300.jpg"  alt="" width="225" height="300"></a></p>
<p>The ear pieces are made&nbsp;of hard plastic, which seems at first glance&nbsp;like a bad choice for something that is going to be&nbsp;against your skin for long periods of time. However, the plastic has a glossy smooth finish, and it rests comfortably in the ear without creating the vacuum suction that silicon in-ear headsets cause. It&rsquo;s nice having something that fits snugly in my ear, but doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s going to suck my brains out. This is also helped by the airflow ports that I talked about above. I have managed to use them for around 2 hours straight before my left ear started getting a little achy. My left ear,&nbsp;which I suspect is smaller than my right ear, usually starts feeling achy around 20-30 minutes with most earbuds.</p>
<p>The sound quality of the Apple EarPods is substantially better than the traditional earbuds. If you&rsquo;re a true audiophile, you&rsquo;re still not going to be satisfied, so don&rsquo;t throw away your Bose or your Beats headsets. For the price, however, the sound these put out is pretty incredible. I tested them on <a title="Amazon.com: 808s &amp;amp; Heartbreak: Kanye West: Music" href="http://www.amazon.com/808s-Heartbreak-Kanye-West/dp/B001FBIPFA">Kanye West&rsquo;s 808s and Heartbreak</a>, <a title="Amazon.com: And Then There Was X: Dmx: Music" href="http://www.amazon.com/And-Then-There-Was-X/dp/B00003IE26">DMX&rsquo;s &hellip;And Then There Was X</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Amazon.com: Ocean Eyes: Owl City: Music" href="http://www.amazon.com/Ocean-Eyes-Owl-City/dp/B002ECN4NM/">Owl City&rsquo;s Ocean Eyes</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Amazon.com: You Get What You Give: Zac Brown Band: Music" href="http://www.amazon.com/You-Get-What-Give/dp/B003V6L94Q/">Zac Brown Band&rsquo;s You Get What You Give</a>, &nbsp;<a title="The Goat Rodeo Sessions | The Official Yo-Yo Ma Site" href="http://www.yo-yoma.com/news/goat-rodeo-sessions">Yo-Yo Ma&rsquo;s The Goat Rodeo&nbsp;Sessions</a>, and <a title="Amazon.com: Own The Night: Lady Antebellum: Music" href="http://www.amazon.com/Own-The-Night-Lady-Antebellum/dp/B0050CJNJ2">Lady Antebellum&rsquo;s Own The Night</a>. The bass was much more solid than before, and the trebles aren&rsquo;t quite&nbsp;as tinny and annoying. As always, the mid-range is where these headsets really shine, but it was more balanced than the older earbuds. On the older earbuds it felt like all you could get out of them was a solid mid-range, painful highs and shallow lows, but this was a well balanced, comfortable blend. If you turn the volume on them beyond the 14th preset volume level, or about 90%, the sound does still get a bit distorted, but not nearly as bad as most other earbuds on the market at the same price point. Also, no one should really be listening to their music that loud since that is far beyond the safe listening volume. I also listened to&nbsp;<a title="Tech News Today | TWiT.TV" href="http://twit.tv/tnt">Tech News Today</a>,&nbsp;<a title="The 404 on CNET. High Tech, Low Brow" href="http://cnettv.cnet.com/the-404/">The 404</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Deemable Tech's Podcast" href="http://dmbl.co/pod">Deemable Tech</a>&nbsp;to see how podcasts sounded. They also sounded crisp, clear and warm.</p>
<p>The microphone/remote has been enlarged&nbsp;to make it easier to use. It feels much more substantial&nbsp;in your fingers than before. The older version felt like two thin pieces of plastic that could snap if you clicked too hard. The new version feels like a real usable piece of equipment. It is also easier to use the controls without looking at them. Even though it is larger, it doesn&rsquo;t feel any heavier, although I expect it might have added a fraction of a gram to the weight of the EarPods.</p>
<p>My favorite feature of the EarPods is the case. I have long desired a decent solution for carrying a pair of earbuds in my pocket since I lost my first pair of earbuds that I purchased back in 1998. They were Sony earbuds that came with a winding, hard plastic case. I always knew where my earbuds where, and they were never tangled. Sadly, Sony discontinued the higher quality version that came with the winding case, and the cheap ones were terrible. I&rsquo;ve tried everything to manage my earbuds so that they don&rsquo;t end up a mangled mess when I actually want to listen to a podcast or music.&nbsp;The case that comes with the Apple EarPods is the best compromise that I have found in the last ten years since I lost them.</p>
<p>The case is hard plastic, but smooth and polished with a nice, rounded rectangular shape. No surprise, it has an engraved Apple logo on the back. The cover of the case is clear plastic and the bottom is white. The cable wraps around the inside of the case and both earpieces and the microphone/remote have special places to insert them to hold them in place. Everything fits nice and securely, except when you put them in your pocket. Then they jiggle around and make a sound like you have maracas in your pocket. Another irritating thing about the EarPods is that the case is perfectly smooth along the edge that separates the case from the lid. This makes it annoyingly difficult to open. I find myself popping the case like a plastic Easter egg to get it open. I expect this will not be good for the long-term use of the case.</p>
<p>Final score, I&rsquo;d give it a 4.5 out of 5. If you get a pair with a new iPhone or iPod, you probably won&rsquo;t want to buy a third-party headset unless you are a true audiophile. If you have a pair of old ear buds and you weren&rsquo;t fully satisfied with them, but didn&rsquo;t want to drop a bunch of money on an expensive headset this would be a great buy. However, the case, although I love the concept, isn&rsquo;t quite perfect. The noise it makes in my pocket is irritating, and it is frustrating to open. It is a really good, first-generation design. I expect it will be refined and re-released down the road. For the <a title="Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic - Apple Store (U.S.)" href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD827LL/A/apple-earpods-with-remote-and-mic">price of $29.00, the Apple EarPods</a>&nbsp;can&rsquo;t be&nbsp;beat. They are available now in Apple Stores, and will be included with the <a title="The iPhone 5 is here! Whoopidy Doo! | Deemable Tech" href="http://deemable.com/2012/09/the-iphone-5-is-here-whoopidy-doo/">iPhone 5</a>&nbsp;and the new iPod touch.</p>

<div><strong>Today&rsquo;s Questions:</strong></div>
<div>
<ul><li>Lauren:<br>
Every time I&rsquo;m watching Netflix on my Wii, it gets hung up. I have to sit and wait for it to finish buffering all the time, and it will get hung up in the middle of watching a show. Is there anyway for me to make my Wi-Fi run faster or is this a problem with Netflix?</li>
<li>Jessica:<br>
My cat is a spoiled brat who only likes sitting on things, because I guess the floor or the couch are too plain for her. Her favorite thing to sit on (other than me) is my laptop. She just really likes to sit on the closed lid. Is this bad, or is the outside of the lid going to protect the laptop sufficiently? If it makes any difference, it&rsquo;s a Dell, and Tesla is not a big cat, weighing only about 10 pounds.</li>
<li>The above-mentioned laptop did a weird thing at startup recently. I logged in to Windows and tried to start up Firefox, but it didn&rsquo;t do anything, and started trying to lock up. I noticed that down in the system tray, there was an icon for Intel Rapid Storage Technology, with a blue circle on it. When I hovered my mouse over it, it said that Intel Rapid Storage Technology was not running. I rebooted, and when it came back up the same icon was there, but it went from a blue circle to a green checkmark, and everything was fine. Firefox came up, and all was happy. Was that the problem, or just a coincidence? I&rsquo;ve never paid attention to that icon before, but now every time I look for it, it has a green check except *right* at startup.</li>
<li>Why are graphics specifications so dumb? I bought a game that, turns out, only supports something like 12 very specific graphics card models. Mine wasn&rsquo;t on that list, so I can&rsquo;t play it. Since then, I&rsquo;ve tried to look at requirements for games before buying them, and most of it&rsquo;s pretty straight forward, like X amount of RAM or a Y Ghz processor or whatever. But the graphics requirements are all different. They always seem to list certain brands and models, then say &ldquo;or better,&rdquo; which is basically useless to me or anyone else using a brand other than the two or three listed. I don&rsquo;t know how my card compares to those specific cards! Why can&rsquo;t they just be numbers, like the other specifications? Do they do this on purpose to make me sad?</li>
<li>Hi, I have a question for ya.<br>
I sometimes listen to Deemable Tech on my iPhone. The problem is, the phone automatically goes to sleep about every 3 minutes and interrupts the show. Is there any way to deactivate this while listening to your show, without having to change it in my settings every time and then change it back once I&rsquo;m finished?<br>
-a Canadian listener</li>
<li>Hunter writes, ?Is there a way to share a website from my computer to my phone besides just emailing myself? It would be nice if there were a quick, easy way to do this. I have a Moto Razr Maxx running Android.?</li>
