<p>After signing contracts with three of the four major music labels (Sony Music  Entertainment, EMI, and the Warner Music Group) to license their  recordings, Apple has just entered the final stages of preparation for its <a title="Cloud computing" href="../tech/2011/04/the-hype-behind-cloud-computing/" target="_blank">cloud-based</a> music service to be launched. Apple is still in negotiations with the largest of the four labels, Universal Music Group, but that deal is expected to be completed by sometime next week.</p>
<p>Like Amazon&rsquo;s <a title="Cloud Drive" href="https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive" target="_blank">Cloud Drive</a> and Google&rsquo;s <a title="Music Beta" href="http://music.google.com/about/" target="_blank">Music Beta</a>, Apple&rsquo;s cloud-based music service would allow users to store their digital music library on the Web and stream it directly to their smartphones, computers, tablets, and other electronic devices. However, unlike Amazon<em></em> and Google&rsquo;s cloud-based music services, which were introduced within the past two months, Apple has taken the added precaution of obtaining licenses from the major music labels as well as beginning to obtain licenses from music publishers, who ultimately control the copyrights   for the composition of songs. While Amazon&rsquo;s <em>Cloud Drive</em> and Google&rsquo;s <em>Music Beta</em> services are free, Apple will likely charge a small fee to be able to  use their streaming music service to offset the cost of the contracts  with music labels and publishers. The permission to use copyrighted material will allow  Apple&rsquo;s cloud music service to have more advanced features than either  Amazon or Google&rsquo;s services though, which are essentially Web-based hard drives  that users would have to directly upload music to. The label licenses would also allow Apple to design a more efficient system in which it is predicted that the service would be able to scan a user&rsquo;s iTunes library and sync these songs to the company&rsquo;s master collection located on Apple&rsquo;s servers, without the hassle of having to upload each song to the cloud &ndash; which could take days.</p>
<p>With a ready market of over 200 million iTunes users, analysts say that Apple might announce the new music service as early as next   month, when the company holds its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco. &ldquo;The Apple <a title="WWDC" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/about/" target="_blank">Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)</a> showcases the latest  innovations and the newest technologies in iOS  and Mac OS X. Over 1,000  Apple engineers guide you through five  exciting days of in-depth  technical sessions and hands-on labs that  demonstrate how to harness the  incredible power of the world&rsquo;s most  advanced operating systems into  your apps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apple fanboys may have to wait a while until the service is ready for a release date though, as the company always makes sure to work out all the kinks and to release a product only when it has been thoroughly tested&hellip; but you should already know that by now, since Apple has seemingly become <a title="Apple Religion" href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/05/19/apple.religion/index.html" target="_blank">its own religion</a>.</p>
