Low-brow. Pop culture and classical literature. There&rsquo;s something for everyone in the debut of Joshua Kreis McTiernan&rsquo;s comedy&nbsp;<em><a title="Players by the Sea: The Creationists" href="http://www.playersbythesea.org/Performances.aspx" target="_blank">The Creationists</a></em>. He took time from the busy play schedule to speak with me about the show and about his upcoming plans.<span id="more-365"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>The Creationists</em> opened on February 18. Can you give us a quick taste of the show?</strong></p>
<p>The theme of the show is rooted in identity. That in itself is nothing new and groundbreaking, but the way you say it can be new. The show acknowledges all levels of humor and silliness. We talk about Postmodernism and men dressing as women. It&rsquo;s not just a play for intellectuals. I wanted to appeal to a broader audience.</p>
<p><strong>This is the first play you have written and produced that will be easily accessible to the public. Can you tell me a little bit about the process?</strong></p>
<p>I took &nbsp;playwriting classes in high school and was pretty good at it. I wrote a high school one act that was produced on one night. I&nbsp;trained as an actor at&nbsp;<a title="Douglas Anderson School of the Arts" href="http://www.da-arts.org/" target="_blank">Douglas Anderson School of the Arts</a> and went back to teach English for two years.&nbsp;Also, I have been involved in community theater since I was in middle school. Being an actor definitely helps in becoming a playwright.</p>
<p><strong>Any plans for the future?</strong></p>
<p>I already have ideas for the next show or two. Writers&rsquo; lives trickle into their art.&nbsp;In a few weeks I will take control of my own story and leave for the <a title="Peace Corps" href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/" target="_blank">Peace Corps</a>. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll still be teaching in the Peace Corps. I&rsquo;ll be teaching English as a language instead of as literature.</p>
