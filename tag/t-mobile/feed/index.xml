<html><body><p style="text-align: center"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/2010/12/01/technology/4g_myth/chart_is_it_4g_v2.top.gif" alt="" width="366" height="205"></p>
<p>Last year, Sprint was the first wireless carrier to announce a fourth generation (4G) wireless network. T-Mobile came next with what it proclaimed as &ldquo;America&rsquo;s largest 4G network.&rdquo; Then Verizon entered the picture with its own 4G network which they announced as the largest and fastest in the United States. AT&amp;T, of course, eventually released its own 4G network to keep up with the competition, but in hindsight, none of these telecommunications giants have a network that can <em>truly</em> be called 4G.&nbsp;In actuality, what these companies are offering is basically a 3.5G network. A marketing ploy. A hoax&hellip;</p>
<p>In November of 2010, the global wireless standards-setting organization, called&nbsp;the International Telecommunication Union,&nbsp;defined 4G as a network that is capable of download speeds of 100 megabits per second (Mbps).&nbsp;While all of the supposed 4G networks out there are clear improvements to the current 3G networks that offer speeds between 500 kbps to 1.5 Mbps, none of them conform to the International Telecommunication Union&rsquo;s 4G definition. Even more perplexing, each carrier has its own 4G network based on different technologies:</p>
<ul><li>Sprint offers a 4G network based on Wi-MAX technology.</li>
<li>T-Mobile offers a 4G network based on an expansion of its 3G-HSPA+ network.</li>
<li>Verizon offers a 4G network based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology.</li>
<li>AT&amp;T offers a 4G network similar to T-Mobile&rsquo;s expanded 3G-HSPA+ network and is set to launch their own LTE 4G network sometime this year.</li>
</ul><p>On Wednesday, however, Congress introduced a bill that would hopefully clear up some of the confusion between all of the different 4G offerings. Initiated by the ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), the Next Generation Wireless Disclosure Act would force wireless carriers to provide specific information about coverage, reliability, speed, pricing, and the type of technology used by the service. A side-by-side comparison of the top 10 competing networks&rsquo; speeds and prices would also be available to consumers,&nbsp;and the bill would get the FCC to work with the wireless providers to establish a guaranteed, minimum speed standard for 4G.</p>
<p>With all confusion and technical jargon aside, the bill is a great proposal to help consumers make better choices. Eshoo explained,&nbsp;&ldquo;Consumers need to know the truth about the speeds they&rsquo;re actually getting. My legislation is simple?it will establish guidelines for understanding what 4G speed really is, and ensure that consumers have all the information they need to make an informed decision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Android has come a long way since the inception of Google&rsquo;s first Android-based smartphone, the HTC Dream. Better known as T-Mobile&rsquo;s G1, the HTC Dream was the 3rd cell phone that I have ever owned, and I definitely saw promise in Google&rsquo;s vision of an open-source platform. With over 1/3 of the smartphone market share, consumers are rapidly joining the bandwagon, and I&rsquo;d like to share some Android apps that I believe will make the transition more worthwhile. Click on the application name to view more information as well as screenshot previews; to view a complete list of the Android applications I have installed, click <a title="David's Apps" href="http://www.appbrain.com/user/DavidAhn" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h1>#1) <img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/NlC6tgocLZqZQD_Jzd2O9eDEfbZFl4zn9j2nYZr0rxhg9l9pEsCLYHclzYv2jgSpVN8w551eJK3x3wgDQ84=s48" alt="Dropbox"><a title="Dropbox" href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/dropbox/com.dropbox.android" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> (Free)</h1>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Dropbox is a free service that lets you bring all your photos, docs, and  videos anywhere.  After you install Dropbox on your computer, any file  you save to your  Dropbox will automatically save to all your computers,  your Android  device, and even the Dropbox website! With the Dropbox app,  you can take everything that matters to you on the go.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Dropbox is a simple way for you to transfer or access files, <em>without </em>the need of a cable connecting your phone and your computer.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>A free navigation system, what more could you ask for?<br><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h1>#3) <img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/2AwYGrYgj8JH2GjvRc1dKsP6rMfc8QlKT636zSDYa6VVKprh3MYT1C-s-_pe6osgR2sQ-2Rainhh2UABVg=s48" alt="Elixir"><a title="Elixir" href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/elixir/bt.android.elixir" target="_blank">Elixir</a> (Free)</h1>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Elixir is a system information application with highly  configurable  widgets. Displays information about battery, cpu usage,  memory usage,  internal and external storage (sd-card), display, wifi,  mobile network,  location services (gps), bluetooth, sync, airplane  mode, sensors, etc.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Elixir is a consolidated system information tool. I&rsquo;ve tried many others like it, but Elixir takes the cake&nbsp;<em>by far</em>. Not only is the UI simple and intuitive, but Tam&aacute;s Barta, the developer, listened to one of the suggestions I sent him via e-mail and immediately implemented it into his next update. He&rsquo;s constantly working on this app and with each update, it has only gotten better!</p>
<h1>#4) <img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/RZy5jTRE7R1AuBFdzzpAucEynUkeN804bsASyTyy_M4qw31K4cCFgWLim7RTQQjrNr8RRKBVsSX0_gjF6H4=s48" alt="Smart Taskbar (sidebar)"><a title="Smart Taskbar" href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/smart-taskbar-%28sidebar%29/com.smart.taskbar" target="_blank">Smart Taskbar</a> (Free)</h1>

<p>Smart Taskbar is a convenient app that runs in the background; simply press the sidebar icon and it pulls up the app drawer without having to leave your current application.</p>
<h1>#5) <img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/1eUKGlpwfr3MP5U28uM5pcSj73nRI82RX3zbwbtuTasykZHRbno5U3Y4i7TBL38avJ4wxztOfxDUrWhTIQ=s48" alt="Fancy Widget"><a title="Fancy Widget" href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/fancy-widget/com.anddoes.fancywidget" target="_blank">Fancy Widget</a> (Free &amp; Pro Version)</h1>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Fancy clock and weather widget with lots of customization options.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Fancy Widget reduces clutter by allowing you to view the date, time, and weather all in one widget. You can even click each individual part of the widget to open either a calendar, alarm clock, or weather application. While the free version is worth a download by itself, the paid version offers hundreds of customizable widget themes that you can toy with.</p>
<h1>#6) <img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/ce52TF2X0HYdTS9DYhaoiB79ykS22f8iExohVhUxb0m0Po0LIx9bwuOVKMfCdgPGnrmSzGHAyIPYnWE8=s48" alt="PowerAMP Music Player (Trial)"><a title="PowerAMP" href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/poweramp-music-player-%28trial%29/com.maxmpz.audioplayer" target="_blank">PowerAMP Music Player</a> (Trial &amp; Pro Version)</h1>
<p><strong>&ldquo;PowerAMP is a powerful music player for Android.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>If you are like me and you like to mess around with your smartphone and customize the hell out of it to fit your own style, then PowerAMP Music Player is not only the best looking music player out there on Android, but offers some of the best features like the lock screen widget and equalizer. The trial version allows you full featured access for 15 days before asking you to purchase it, but it definitely is worth it considering you will be able to download it at no extra cost on any Android phone you own in the future as well.</p>
<h1>#7) <img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/z90nCKfX7ClTVJu8Hccesj3KHHsCUiOJAfgMLQtYreOlXMNTpKn5gvFPNi7BUlGMQknyozailaC3yFSR=s48" alt="Dolphin Browser?

<p>Both Dolphin Browser HD and Dolphin Browser Mini are <em>much </em>better than the stock Web browser that comes on most Android phones. Both offer intuitive UI design and are more efficient/faster than most of the other top browsers I have tried (Opera Mini, Firefox Mobile, MIREN Browser).</p>
<h1>#8) <img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/B6HF4fFK-OXPCx8UQOPxYxTZyhOdfPlMiyp4OkwEfrFn0wyy3mc85perlojufE8Ju_Ui4kGkVIHYJv59bg=s48" alt="Camera360 Ultimate"><a title="Camera360" href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/camera360-ultimate/vStudio.Android.GPhotoPaid" target="_blank">Camera360</a> (Free &amp; Pro Version)</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>(For Rooted Android Phones)</h1>
<h1>#9) <img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/GEwS6nzY0i6oVTqupcsrgzwdMrulHubuepVR1KfwZ6nbNgqne8H2dptn3IIV4FhMBABf-7xNWMGE32WIeA=s48" alt="Titanium Backup ? root"><a title="Titanium Backup" href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/titanium-backup-%E2%98%85-root/com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup" target="_blank">Titanium Backup</a> (Free &amp; Pro Version)</h1>

<p>A real lifesaver. Once you are rooted, Titanium Backup is one of the apps that you will be downloading first. It allows you to backup your existing apps and system data so that you can easily restore them.</p>
<h1>#10) <img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/pmU8ZhLQqDYRb1OGWf6Ug_kRcRyi4qZVNXWC7eYjBZR6GkRRX_dYY0vCBpC2S35CEBdFkRx2gulBdlb0mQ=s48" alt="Root Explorer (File Manager)"><a title="Root Explorer" href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/root-explorer-%28file-manager%29/com.speedsoftware.rootexplorer" target="_blank">Root Explorer</a> (Paid Version Only)</h1>

A precursor to the end of times? Call it what you&rsquo;d like, but AT&amp;T is offering Deutsche Telekom AG 39 billion reasons to sell T-Mobile. The potential mega-merger will face strict scrutiny over the next year by the government, the media, and the public, but one thing is certain &ndash; current T-Mobile users have a cause for concern.</p>
<p>As a satisfied customer of T-Mobile since 2002, there are two things that I believe set this cell phone provider apart from the rest, and that is their loyalty to customer service and their great pricing strategy.</p>
<p>So what could this merger mean for us T-Mobile users? Although the networks of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile use the same underlying cellular technology, T-Mobile users who currently have 3G wireless mobile broadband service would eventually have to upgrade to AT&amp;T&rsquo;s 3G or 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) data services. Say goodbye to $30 unlimited data plans for our beloved Smartphones, and say hello to expensive, capped data plans that charge overage fees. With a company as large as AT&amp;T, customer service is not a primary driving point for their business model and by adding an additional 33.7 million more U.S. customers, how bad could it possibly get? Look on the bright side though, fellow T-Mobilers: You would have a wider array of phones to choose from, including the coveted Apple iPhone, and a merger could lead to better network coverage throughout the States. Although we will have to wait and watch the outcome unfold, if the deal is eventually approved though, I&rsquo;ll be making sure that I&rsquo;m not one of the people left asking, &ldquo;Can you hear me now?&rdquo;</p>
