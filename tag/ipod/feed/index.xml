<html><body><p><script id="prx-p110077-embed" src="http://www.prx.org/p/110077/embed.js?size=small"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Q:</strong> How do I switch my iTunes account from an old computer, which is broken, to my new computer? I&rsquo;ve downloaded iTunes onto the new computer, but, of course, it doesn&rsquo;t recognize my account.&nbsp;The real problem is my iPod. I have all my music on it, but now I am not able to add to it to iTunes.<span id="more-8561"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8569" src="/media/2014/01/TransferiTunesFromiPodToNewComputer-300x300.png" alt="How to transfer iTunes from iPod to new computer" width="300" height="300"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>A:</strong> Well, first of all, Phil, your new computer <em>should</em> recognize your iTunes account. If it doesn&rsquo;t, you have a problem that you need to contact Apple about. You may have to reset your iTunes password. Hopefully you still have access to the e-mail address you gave Apple for your account.&nbsp;Once iTunes does recognize your account, you need to authorize your computer. Sign into iTunes, then click the Store tab at the top and click &ldquo;authorize this computer.&rdquo; You should now be able to re-download any songs you purchased through iTunes. However, any songs that you ripped from CDs, or acquired through other questionable methods, are still trapped on your iPod. Apple made it this way so people couldn?t use their iPods to transfer illegally shared music between computers. But in this situation, their safeguard is a real hassle for you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Regardless of how you acquired your music, and we are not here to judge, your music isn&rsquo;t trapped on your iPod forever. You can transfer it to your computer, but it takes a little work, unless you are willing to pay for an app. We&rsquo;ll show you how to do it the hard way first, then if you decide that&rsquo;s not for you, we&rsquo;ll include a link to the app at the bottom. Here&rsquo;s how to do it if you have a Windows PC.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Transferring your iTunes library from an iPod to a new Windows PC</h3>
<p dir="ltr">When you plug your iPod into your PC, you need to stop it from auto-syncing. To do this, hold down Shift and Ctrl while you plug in your iPod. Then, you can open your iPod like an external hard drive, by going to My Computer and double-clicking the iPod.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, if you double-click on the iPod and you get an error message asking you to format your iPod, stop! Your iPod was formatted for a Mac. If this is the case, you&rsquo;ll need a program called MacDrive to see your Mac formatted iPod on your Windows computer. But hopefully this won&rsquo;t happen to you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once you get it open, you need to reveal your hidden files. Each version of Windows has a slightly different way to do it, so if you&rsquo;ve never revealed your hidden files before, just search Google or Bing for &ldquo;Show Hidden Files Windows&rdquo; and whatever version of Windows you have &ldquo;XP, 7 or 8&rdquo; Click on the first search results that are from Microsoft. Follow those directions, and you&rsquo;ll be able to see your hidden files on your iPod.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, once you have your iPod open, look for a folder called &ldquo;iPod-Control.&rdquo; In there, you&rsquo;ll find another folder labeled &ldquo;Music.&rdquo; Copy that folder to your computer. Now, open iTunes, and click File and Add to Library. Navigate to the Music folder you copied to your desktop, and iTunes will import everything. Your files will have random four letter names, but as soon as they are imported to iTunes, the song titles and artists will be restored.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Transferring your iTunes library from an iPod to a new Mac</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">If you have a Mac, it&rsquo;s a little more complicated, but you&rsquo;ll do basically the same thing. However, &nbsp;unless you buy an app, you will have to go into the Terminal.&nbsp;</span>Hold down Command and Option while you plug in the iPod. Then you will launch Terminal, and enter &ldquo;defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE&rdquo; and then enter &ldquo;killall Finder&rdquo; Now you&rsquo;ll click on the iPod in iTunes, click the Summary tab and check box next to Enable Disc Use.</p>
<p>Now, open Finder, open the iPod, open the folder iPod-Control and copy the Music folder to your Desktop. Then, open iTunes, and click File and Add to Library.&nbsp;Navigate to the Music folder you copied to your desktop, and iTunes will import everything.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Transferring your iTunes library from an iPod with an app</span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;ve read the instructions above, and you are completely overwhelmed, there are two other options. First, you could buy an app that will do most of the heavy lifting for you. If you have an iPod touch, iPhone, or iPad, <a title="DiskAid by DigiDNA" href="http://www.digidna.net/diskaid">DiskAid</a>&nbsp;will do the trick. With DiskAid you can&nbsp;copy music, video, text messages and your contacts from your iOS device. If you have a iPod classic or Nano, <a href="http://www.imobie.com/podtrans-pro/">PodTrans Pro</a> will do the job for you. PodTrans Pro will also convert incompatible file formats for you so you can watch Windows Media files on your iPod. Both DiskAid and PodTrans Pro&nbsp;work on Windows and Mac.&nbsp;If the only thing concerning you is diving into the Terminal on your Mac is concerning you, you can download <a title="Houdini for Mac" href="https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/26729/houdini">Houdini for Mac</a> which will make your hidden files and folders visible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The other option is to have someone do it for you. Most IT service companies can transfer the music files for you, and they usually won&rsquo;t charge too much for the job. Check out our <a title="Deemable Tech Business Directory" href="/business-directory/">business directory</a> for some good companies that should be able to help you out.</p>

<html><body><p>If you still haven&rsquo;t purchased your <strong>special someone</strong> a present for Valentine&rsquo;s Day, your <strong>sweet-heart</strong> is a gadget junkie, and there&rsquo;s an electronics store on the way home, this article might help you from spending the night snuggled up with Fido. Here&rsquo;s a list of eleven tech gifts under $100 (and one at $129) that will make great last-minute Valentine&rsquo;s Day presents.</p>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>iPod shuffle &ndash; $49</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iPodShuffleAllColors.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-4921 alignleft" title="I see your true colors, and that's why I love you..." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iPodShuffleAllColors-150x150.jpg"  alt="All of the colors of the iPod shuffle" width="135" height="135"></a>The iPod shuffle is a great gift for folks who work out a lot, take the dog for long walks, or who lose things easily. At only $49, it is the cheapest device from Apple that you can buy for your <strong>sweetie pie</strong>, but the sacrifice is that she&rsquo;ll only be able to put about 350 songs on the 2GB of internal storage. Just make sure that she didn&rsquo;t mean to say &ldquo;<a title="Apple - iPod touch - Now in white. It has fun written all over it." href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/" target="_blank">iPod touch</a>&rdquo; (the iPod shuffle&rsquo;s more expensive, touch-screen cousin) when she said she wanted an iPod, or the iPod shuffle might be the <em>only</em> thing you get to touch on Valentine&rsquo;s.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Jawbone Up &ndash; $99.99</h3>
<h3><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/JawboneUp-e1328748635428.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-4901 alignleft" title='Jawbone Up - The tech gadget that says "Get up, (get on up) Get up, (get on up) Stay on the scene, (get on up), like a..."' src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/JawboneUp-300x150.jpg"  alt="Jawbone Up" width="180" height="90"></a></h3>
<p>Available in black, white, red, blue and silver, the Jawbone up is more than just another rubbery bracelet that looks like it stole its design from Lance Armstrong&rsquo;s <a title="LIVESTRONG.COM - Lose Weight &amp; Get Fit with Diet, Nutrition &amp; Fitness Tools" href="http://www.livestrong.com/" target="_blank">LIVESTRONG</a> campaign. The Jawbone Up has a motion sensor inside that monitors your <strong>dearest one&rsquo;s</strong> activity during the day and sleep at night. Then, it syncs with and displays all that information on an app on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. During the day, the Jawbone Up will keep track of how many steps your <strong>stud muffin</strong> takes, calculate how many calories he burned, and he can set it to remind him to get up and get moving when he&rsquo;s been staring at the computer screen for too long. At night, it keeps track of how long it took him to fall asleep, how many hours he slept, and how much of it was light or deep sleep. In the morning, the Jawbone Up will silently wake your <strong>Prince Charming</strong> with the Smart Alarm. The Smart Alarm wakes him up at the ideal point in his sleep cycle just before his desired wake up time by gently vibrating on his wrist. You&rsquo;re <strong>sugar pie</strong> will wake up feeling like a million bucks, and you&rsquo;ll get to sleep in!</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>iPod nano &ndash; $129</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iPodNanoWatch.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4925" title="Her girlfriends will ask her, 'Is that an iPod nano on your wrist or does your man just love you more than mine loves me?'" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iPodNanoWatch-e1328757231886-150x150.jpg"  alt="iPod Nano with a red watch band and Minnie Mouse watch face." width="150" height="150"></a>For an extra eighty dollars over the price of the iPod shuffle, the iPod nano offers a lot more bang for your buck. Starting at 8 GB, it can hold around 1,400 songs, and it has a multi-touch, color screen. Additionally, it has a built-in accelerometer and it works with Nike + iPod compatible cardio machines to keep track of all of your <strong>buttercup&rsquo;s</strong> workouts. It also has an FM radio that she can pause, rewind and fast forward live radio, and with one of the many third-party wristbands available it makes a nifty watch with 18 different watch faces.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Apple TV &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/TVappleTVandRemote.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4934" title="Apple TV" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/appletv.jpg"  alt="" width="130" height="130"></a>With an Apple TV, your <strong>cuddly-wuddly</strong> can watch or listen to anything in his iTunes account, stream Netflix, Vimeo, and YouTube videos and watch live sports from the NBA, NFL and NHL. With the airplay feature, he can stream anything from his iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to the big screen of his home television. Another benefit is its simple and easy set up; your guy can start enjoying the Apple TV right away when he invites you over tonight for a movie and snuggle session.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Roku 2 XS &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Roku2_XS_Remote.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4959" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Roku2_XS_Remote-300x225.jpg"  alt="Roku2 XS with Remote" width="162" height="122"></a>If your <strong>snuggle-bear</strong> isn&rsquo;t an Apple fanboy, but he would still like to watch video from the Internet on his big screen TV, another great option is the Roku 2 XS, which offers some of the same features, including the NBA, NHL, and Netflix, but also includes more features like Amazon Instant Video, Pandora, Hulu Plus and even Angry Birds; however, it doesn&rsquo;t support Air Play or iTunes. Another benefit of the Roku 2 XS over the Apple TV is that it is backwards compatible with older televisions. So, even if your <strong>hunk</strong> doesn&rsquo;t have a high-definition TV, he can still invite you over to watch <a title="Netflix - The English Patient" href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=477351&amp;trkid=4451748&amp;t=The+English+Patient" target="_blank">The English Patient</a> on Netflix.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>iPhone 4 &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iphone4-black.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4945" title="It doesn't have Siri, but it's not too shabby." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iphone4-black.png"  alt="iPhone 4" width="150" height="150"></a>The Apple iPhone 4 is great for the girlfriend who is disorganized and perpetually running late for the special dates you plan. It may not be an iPhone 4S, but at $99 the iPhone 4 won&rsquo;t break the bank either. With easy scheduling and reminders, great games, and FaceTime for late-night romantic chats with your <strong>darling</strong>, the iPhone 4 is an excellent all-in-one gadget for last-minute gift-givers. If your honey is an Android fan, there is also a plethora of <a title="Android Central | Phones Category | Sorted by Price" href="https://wl-androidcentral.bbymsolutions.com/category/phones?navCode=4tDTVKmeZ9&amp;sort=lowPrice&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Android smart phones available for $99 or less</a>.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Kindle &ndash; $79 &amp; Kindle Touch &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Kindle-Touch-store-e1328762980318.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-4948" title="Toucha toucha toucha touch me, I wanna be..." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Kindle-Touch-store-e1328762980318-150x150.jpg"  alt="Kindle Touch" width="150" height="150"></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/kindlejeans.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4995" style="margin: 10px;" title="Kindle e-Reader - Don't take it the wrong way, but it wants to get into your jeans." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/kindlejeans-e1329190497112-150x150.jpg"  alt="Kindle e-Reader" width="120" height="120"></a>If your <strong>beloved</strong> is a bookworm, the Kindle (on the right) or Kindle touch (on the left) are both excellent choices. The Kindle Touch is light, fast, and small with a touchscreen and audio features, although books can only be downloaded when wi-fi connected, and at this price it is ad-supported. The regular Kindle is lighter and skinnier than its Touch counterpart and has the same size screen, but getting around the menus requires using a directional pad, and it doesn&rsquo;t play music or audio books. If she loves to read but complains that she can&rsquo;t find the time, she may not even know how much she would enjoy this device. It is very convenient to find new books in the Kindle bookstore, and she may find the time to read once she has a device that fits easily in her purse or her back pocket.</p>

<h3>Nook Simple Touch &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BarnesNobleNook.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4954" title="More touchy-feely stuff" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BarnesNobleNook-250x300.jpg"  alt="Barnes &amp; Noble Nook" width="120" height="144"></a>Another e-reader that makes a great last-minute gift for your <strong>sweetiekins</strong> is the Nook Simple Touch. The Nook boasts that it is 25% faster than any other reader, and it does not have any ads; however, it does not have a web browser, and, like the regular Kindle, it does not play music or audio books.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750 &ndash; $59.99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Logitech_K750.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4956" title="Sunshine on my keyboard keeps it charged up..." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Logitech_K750-300x165.jpg"  alt="Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750" width="168" height="92"></a>If your <strong>heartthrob</strong>&nbsp;is always busy blogging, the Logitech solar keyboard is the perfect choice. It&rsquo;s green technology requires no batteries, no wires, and offers easy setup. This is a gadget that will make your man&rsquo;s life easier and his desk more streamlined. It runs on&nbsp;Windows&reg; XP, Windows Vista&reg;, Windows&reg; 7 and Mac OS&reg; X 10.4. It reportedly works on most flavors of Linux too, but it&rsquo;s not specifically supported.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Powermat &ndash; $79.99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/power-mat.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4962" title="It's not a hoverboard, but it's still pretty awesome." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/power-mat-300x156.jpg"  alt="Powermat" width="210" height="109"></a></p>
<p>For the <strong>hunk</strong> who already has all the gadgets that he wants, the perfect Valentine&rsquo;s gift is a wireless charging mat called the Powermat. As a former Palm Pre owner, I miss being able to just set my phone down on the Touchstone and charge it without having to plug it in. With the Powermat and a matching&nbsp;receiver door, almost any device can work just like my Pre did. The Powermat simplifies the charging process and cuts down visual cord clutter for a guy who juggles several electronic devices. Plus, it&rsquo;s just really cool.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>OtterBox &ndash; $19.95 &ndash; 49.955</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Otterbox.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4961" title="Don't go breaking my phone. I won't go breaking your phone..." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Otterbox-172x300.jpg"  alt="The OtterBox for iPhone" width="103" height="180"></a>For the clumsy girlfriend, some sort of protection for her gadgets is in order. One of the best of device-protecting accessories is the OtterBox. These range in price (Defender Series $49.95, Reflex Series $34.95, Commuter Series $34.95, Impact Series $19.95), but are well worth the extra dollar spent when her device accidentally goes flying off the couch and hits the floor during an intense snuggling session with your <strong>mamacita</strong>.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs, who has been on medical leave since January, triumphantly walked out to a standing ovation at this year&rsquo;s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Taking place in San Francisco, the gaunt and seemingly frail Apple CEO managed to address the thousands of developers in attendance by revealing major developments in Apple software that will be coming soon to consumers throughout the world.</p>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Mac OS X &ldquo;Lion&rdquo;</strong></span></div>
<p>The latest Mac Operating System, called <em>Lion</em>, will add 250 new improvements &ndash; such as multi-touch gestures for controlling applications. As the eighth major release of Mac OS, Apple has taken a step in a different direction by making the new release emulate the mobile iOS platform. Jobs has stated in the past that the PC-era will soon pass by, and with over 50 million Mac users across the globe his vision is coming into fruition. The software update will be on sale next month exclusively in the Mac App Store, and unlike previous Mac updates that usually cost $129.99, the 4GB <em>Lion</em> update can be downloaded for a mere $29.</p>

<div><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>iOS 5</strong></span></div>
<p>After selling over 200 million iOS devices like the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch,<br>
the highly popular mobile Apple iOS software will receive a much-anticipated update in the fall. Over 200 new features will be added including Notification Center, iMessage, Newsstand, and built-in Twitter integration. Users will be sent the new update over-the-air after it was announced that iOS devices will no longer require syncing with a computer to be activated or receive updates.</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="752" height="453" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LLJIef-e-7g?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>iCloud</strong></span></p>
<p>The headliner of the WWDC was undoubtedly the unveiling of Apple&rsquo;s iCloud, a free wireless storage and syncing system. Based on the idea of cloud computing, which allows users to store files and applications on the internet instead of on their own devices, the iCloud will help further integrate and synchronize Apple devices in an efficient and simple manner. Using Apple&rsquo;s servers, new files that a user loads onto their device will be automatically pushed and available in &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; without having to manually sync or transfer anything.</p>
<p>Several features set Apple&rsquo;s cloud computing service apart from competing cloud systems launched by Amazon and Google. The largest competitive advantage that the iCloud holds is its iTunes integration. As rumored before its release, iTunes will automatically push a user&rsquo;s purchased song to all other devices running iTunes at no charge. For an additional $25 a year, though, you can access up to 20,000 songs from your entire iTunes library through a new service known as iTunes Match, which scans the iTunes library and matches it to the millions of songs that the company acquired licensing rights to. Users can also upload additional songs that haven&rsquo;t found a match using the new program. Besides the iTunes integration, iCloud will also integrate with applications, documents, and photos.</p>
<p>Apple iCloud is set to fully launch during the fall, but some features are available right now.</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="752" height="453" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAYA7WfNjjI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>

<html><body><p>I have a confession to make. I am attached to my laptop. I fall asleep with it running near my bed. When I wake up, I check my email before I brush my teeth. As a freelance writer, my livelihood depends on a steady connection and speedy applications. Last week I reluctantly put my MacBook in the hands of a computer repair friend and he noted, &ldquo;You have computer separation anxiety.&rdquo; While CSA is not (yet) recognized by any psychology journals, there are some options to lessen the fear that comes from being away from your computer.<br>
These apps can keep your business running whether you are sneaking your iPhone with you on a family vacation* or working through lunch.</p>
<div class="apps"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/iphoneapp"><img class="logos" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/dropbox-small.png" alt="Dropbox App Logo" width="48" height="48"></a><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/iphoneapp" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> It&rsquo;s easy to work across multiple computers when I put my work in progress in Dropbox. It&rsquo;s secure and syncs quickly.</div>
<div class="apps"><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=n4MZJN75Txs&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pulse-news-mini/id377594176?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow"><img class="logos" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/pulse-logo-e1298430988102.png" alt="Pulse App Logo" width="48" height="48"></a><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=n4MZJN75Txs&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pulse-news-mini/id377594176?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">Pulse</a> I like the interface for this app. I can stay on top of news and keep up-to-date on all my favorite sites with the swipe of a finger. It&rsquo;s easy to scroll back for archives and share favorite articles.</div>
<div class="apps"><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/mail-ical-address-book.html"><img class="logos" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ical-small-e1298429658149.png" alt="iCal App Logo" width="48" height="48"></a><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/mail-ical-address-book.html" target="_blank">iCal</a> Keeping track of meeting times with clients in different time zones can be tricky. I like setting email reminders of important events. This app is also cool because I can import my <a href="http://calendar.google.com/" target="_blank">Google calendars</a> as well.</div>
<div class="apps"><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=n4MZJN75Txs&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/godocs-for-ipad-iphone-google/id348792440?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow"><img class="logos" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/GoDocs-logo-e1298429994369.jpg" alt="GoDocs App Logo" width="48" height="48"></a><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=n4MZJN75Txs&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/godocs-for-ipad-iphone-google/id348792440?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">GoDocs</a> Continuing my Google obsession, my workday would not be complete without <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/" target="_blank">Google Docs</a>. &nbsp;I use the spreadsheets to keep track of mileage and expenses.</div>
<div class="apps"><a href="https://personal.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=marketing_us/mobile_iphone"> <img class="logos" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/paypal-e1298433164113.png" alt="PayPal App Logo" width="48" height="48"></a><a href="https://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank">PayPal</a> I like knowing when a client makes a payment. Through Paypal, I can send invoices for unpaid bills.</div>
<p>*Please note that I do not advocate sneaking an iPhone on family vacations. I hear it is healthy to unplug and bond with those who still love you.</p>
<p>How do you remain productive away from the office? Let me know in the comments if I missed any awesome apps.</p>
