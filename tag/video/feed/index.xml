<html><body><p>It&rsquo;s  been a slow week in the Tech world and while I could write about the latest developments in fields such as biometrics or cellular technology in order to bore you to death, I would much rather share with everyone something unique that I happened to stumble upon this morning.</p>
<p>From traveling across the world to rekindle a romance, or giving one&rsquo;s life to save another&hellip; love can drive people to do unpredictable things. Sometimes these unpredictable actions have bad results when driven by jealous, blinding anger, but when the intentions are good, the outcome often leaves a touching story to be told for years to come. Now, more than ever before, these stories can be easily experienced by the whole world thanks to the advancements in technology and especially due to the acceptance and widespread use of digital media over the last ten years.</p>
<p>So while I was surfing the web in search of a topic to write about today, I inadvertently found this video of a  man proposing to his fianc&eacute; in what can only be described as one of the  most romantic marriage proposals <em>ever</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i3.ytimg.com/i/ja5HAHWLpwPNWe93jBqTDg/1.jpg?v=bd62b2" alt="" width="88" height="88"></p>
<p>Meet Matt &amp; Ginny from Georgia, whose video was posted only 3 days ago and already has nearly 3 million views on YouTube.</p>
<p>Matt wanted to surprise Ginny with a proposal that she would never be able to forget; it came in the form of a movie trailer where he would ask for her father&rsquo;s approval to take his daughter&rsquo;s hand in marriage and&hellip; well, you need to see the rest of the video to get the whole story.</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="560" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pnVAE91E7kM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
<p>Learn more about Matt &amp; Ginny and the background behind the proposal in their Hot 89.9 interview from yesterday:</p>
<span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="425" height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McKa_Vbh5Go?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
<p>Needless to say, Matt has really set the bar high for the rest of us  with his proposal. Honestly, Matt, how are we supposed to top this?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd">
<html><body><p>The DMC-GH2, the newest camera in Panasonic&rsquo;s Micro Four Thirds line, delivers a vast array of features in a relatively small package. What sets the camera apart from the pack is its rare combination of image and video quality. The Gh2 is one of the first cameras to offer stills and video of such high quality at this price point (around $900 MSRP for the body only).</p>
<p>What differentiates&nbsp;Micro Four Thirds cameras from the enormous DSLRs you see tourists, birdwatchers, and soccer moms lugging around is that they include no mirrors or optical viewfinders. The omission of the mirror and slightly smaller sensor size allow for significantly smaller and lighter cameras and lenses, while still delivering considerable image quality and competitive feature sets. In place of the mirror and optical viewfinder found in traditional DSLR cameras, the GH2 sports an electronic viewfinder composed of more than a million pixels, delivering a vibrant, crystal-clear image. In addition to the electronic viewfinder is a 460 thousand dot swivel touch screen.</p>
<div id="attachment_1875" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/panasonic-gh2-slant.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1875" src="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/panasonic-gh2-slant-300x200.jpg"  alt="" width="300" height="200"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The GH2 showing off its swivel touch screen.</p></div>
<p>Fans of touch screens will be pleased, as the GH2&rsquo;s proves quite responsive. While providing the ability to alter general camera settings, it also allows the user to focus and take pictures simply by clicking anywhere on the screen.&nbsp;For those who prefer a more tactile relationship with their camera, there&rsquo;s a nice big mode dial, a ?clickable? thumbwheel on the back of the camera, as well as several customizable function buttons.</p>
<p>Even though the image sensor found in Micro Four Thirds cameras and in the GH2 is a little bit smaller than in a standard DSLR system, image quality remains fantastic, and higher ISO sensitivities are much cleaner than on your standard point and shoot.&nbsp;Fans of shallow depth of field will find that they can isolate their subjects nicely, given the right lens and aperture&ndash;although it is admittedly more difficult to get the same shallow depth of field on a camera like the GH2, especially when compared to a DSLR with a full-frame sensor.</p>
<p>Ergonomically, the GH2 feels pretty comfortable in the hand with its sizable grip. Its small size and lightweight design allow for comfortable one-handed shooting, while remaining heavy enough for steady low-light shots.</p>
<p>Above all, the video quality of the GH2 has many amateur filmmakers scrambling to get their creative little hands on one. The camera records 1080 24p full HD video, providing a high resolution and cinematic picture. Unfortunately for those in the USA, the GH2 has largely eluded online and retail stores since its announcement, late last year.</p>
<p>On the top of the camera you&rsquo;ll find a built-in stereo microphone. This included microphone records some decent sound, but for more serious work you&rsquo;ll probably want to invest in an external microphone.</p>
<p>While the GH2 is currently a unique camera, those who are after sheer image quality and don&rsquo;t care about video capabilities are still better off going for a more traditional DSLR of the Nikon or Canon variety. &nbsp;Nonetheless, if it&rsquo;s smaller size and a balance of great image quality and superb video capture that you&rsquo;re after, there&rsquo;s little that can touch the GH2 right now.</p>
<p>The Micro Four Thirds camera system and the GH2 present some exciting changes in the photography world. The technology is far from perfect just yet, but it&rsquo;s hard to argue against mirrorless cameras being the future of photography.</p>

<html><body><p>Have you ever wondered what it was like to get hit by a tsunami and survive? Well, thanks to this survivor and his conveniently timed filming, you can. Why he was using a video camera when his car was hit by the colossal wave from the tsunami is anyone&rsquo;s guess. Fortunately, he kept his cool and let the waves subside before he tried to get out of the car, and he kept a hold on his video camera so that we could see how it all unfolded as he experienced it.</p>
