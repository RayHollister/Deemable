For those of you not in the know, this isnâ€™t all that new. Years ago, various computer vendors set out to improve things with hardware-based two-factor authentication: Something uniquely in your possession that would generate a one-time code to work with a security appliance and better secure your logins. RSA made millions in this market, and over the years these tokens have been used by millions of users.

<html><body><p>Passwords are getting easier to crack even as we more create more complicated passwords. <a href="http://hashcat.net/oclhashcat-plus/">Hashcat</a>, one of the leading password cracking software programs was just upgraded to allow it to break passwords of up to 55 characters in length. In addition to using a program like LastPass or Dashlane to store individual passwords for every website you log into, you should use two-factor authentication for every site that offers it. For more on two-factor authentication, here&rsquo;s David Strom&rsquo;s article from Dice News in Tech.</p>
