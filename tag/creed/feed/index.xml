<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood why people hate the rock band <a href="http://www.creed.com/" target="_blank">Creed</a> so much. While I&rsquo;m not a huge fan, I&rsquo;ve always found their music at least palatable. However, from all of the Creed hate I read on the interwebs, it would seem that I am not in the majority. There are over five million pages of search results for the phrase <a title='Let me google that for you: "I Hate Creed"' href="http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=I+hate+Creed" target="_blank">&ldquo;I hate Creed&rdquo;</a> and several Facebook pages and groups dedicated to the hatred of all things Creed. Now, apparently even wild life hates Creed.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a&nbsp;Norwegian&nbsp;boy used Creed to fend off a pack of wild wolves. On his way home from school, a pack of four hungry, but clearly &nbsp;musically&nbsp;snobbish&nbsp;wolves approached young Walter Eikrem. Thinking on his toes, Walter grabbed the nearest weapon he could find to fight off the beasts: his <a title="Sony " href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/corporate/products/phoneportfolio/specification/xperiax8" target="_blank">Sony Ericsson Xperia X8</a> phone that was blasting <a title="YouTube - Creed - Overcome" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFLXxqoapPY" target="_blank">Creed&rsquo;s &ldquo;Overcome&rdquo;</a> in his earbuds. He yanked the headset out of the phone and turned the phone up as loud as the little tiny speaker could go. He yelled and waved his arms while <a href="http://www.scottstappofficial.com/" target="_blank">Scott Stapp</a>&lsquo;s vocals screamed from the little white Android phone. Seeing, and most&nbsp;importantly, hearing all of this, the wolves just turned around and left.</p>
<p>Now, did the wolves really just hate the sound of Creed&rsquo;s first single in seven years, or is there something more sinister afoot here? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.winduprecords.com/" target="_blank">Wind-Up Records</a>, Creed&rsquo;s label,&nbsp;just happens to be owned by <a href="http://www.sonymusic.com/" target="_blank">Sony Music Entertainment</a>,&nbsp;which just happens to be owned by <a href="http://www.sony.net/" target="_blank">Sony</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;which just happens to own half of <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/" target="_blank">Sony Ericsson</a>, which just happens to be the company that makes the Xperia X8! (OK, when I started that rant, I didn&rsquo;t realize how many layers were involved. I even skipped Sony Corporation of America.) The Xperia X8 was featured&nbsp;prominently in every story about this young boy&rsquo;s little&nbsp;convenient&nbsp;miracle. Perhaps, this was all an elaborate setup to create a viral story to promote two of Sony&rsquo;s interests. I would like to believe that just the wolves were agents working for Sony, (maybe they were prototypes of Sony&rsquo;s new attack <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIBO">AIBO</a>) and Walter is innocent in all of this, but honestly, even in Norway, what kid is going to admit that he listens to Creed? This whole story smells of a&nbsp;conspiracy, or I&rsquo;ve been watching too many TV mysteries and I haven&rsquo;t had enough sleep lately.</p>
