<html><body><p><b>Q:&nbsp;</b>I&rsquo;m a writer and working on a new blog, where I&rsquo;ll post a new article every week. A friend suggested that I do a weekly podcast, too. How do I do that? What kind of equipment do I need, and how do I market my podcast?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very good at tech terms, so when I looked up this question on the web it just confused me. Is there someone who can walk me through the process and give me a better understanding about podcasts, and blogging in general? I have a &ldquo;computer guy&rdquo; but he doesn&rsquo;t know anything about podcasts.<span id="more-8937"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2012/11/WhatIsAPodcast.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright wp-image-6298" src="/media/2012/11/WhatIsAPodcast.png"  alt="What Is A Podcast?" width="280" height="280"></a><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Great question, Karen. Here at Deemable Tech we are actually able to record in a professional studio, but that&rsquo;s not an option for most people. However, you can still record a great podcast right in your own home.</p>
<p>At the bare minimum, you need a computer and a good microphone. If you have nothing but that, you can start recording a podcast. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a Windows or a Mac, both have plenty of software available to do the job. Macs, however,&nbsp;come with the software you need built-in. And, those software programs are a bit easier to use that their PC counterparts.</p>
<p>The kind of microphone you should get&nbsp;depends a lot on your budget, and the amount of time you want to invest in learning about sound production. On the simple end of things, you can get a microphone that plugs into the USB port of your computer for anywhere from 50 to 200 hundred dollars. Most of the major microphone manufacturers make a USB model.</p>
<p>The Audio-Technica AT2020 is one we like, and we&rsquo;ve always had a soft-spot for&nbsp;the Blue Microphone Yeti.</p>
<p>Once you have a good mic, the next step is&nbsp;to record your&nbsp;podcast. You&rsquo;ll&nbsp;need some software to do that. As&nbsp;we&nbsp;mentioned before, on the Mac there is a built-in program to do the job &ndash; it?s called GarageBand. You can also download a free program called Audacity for Windows <em>or</em> Mac. It&nbsp;does a great job recording, and it is pretty easy to use it to edit your recordings.</p>
<p>Once you have your podcast recorded, you are ready to take the big step of putting it out on the internet.</p>
<p>Now, here&rsquo;s where it can get nerdy. You&rsquo;ll need to either setup a website that can host an RSS feed, or you&rsquo;ll have to use a service to publish your podcast for you. If your blog is a WordPress site, you can just create a new category named podcast, and then you&rsquo;ll publish all of your podcast episodes in the podcast category. WordPress creates an RSS feed for you, which is the technical term for what a podcast really is. If that sounds too complicated for you, there are services that will set it up for you. One good one is called BuzzSprout. You have to pay for BuzzSprout in addition to your website hosting, but it gets the job done, and it&rsquo;s really easy to set up.</p>
<p>Once you get it published, then you need to advertise it. The best way to advertise it is to get it listed in podcast directories, like the big one,&nbsp;iTunes. It doesn&rsquo;t cost anything to be listed in iTunes, but you practically <em>have</em> to be listedthere if you are ever going to be heard. More people listen to podcasts listed on iTunes than anywhere else. But there are other great podcast services like Stitcher and Slacker Radio as well. List your podcast in as many places as possible.</p>
<p>Hopefully that will get you pointed in the right direction, Karen.&nbsp;Another great resource to getting a podcast started is, ironically, a podcast.&nbsp;Download the Podcast app for iPhone or iPod or just open iTunes and search for Podcasting for Dummies. This is the companion podcast for the book Podcasting for Dummies. There&rsquo;s a lot of great information in the podcast, and it&rsquo;s completely free.</p>
<p>Check that out and you&rsquo;ll be on your way to internet stardom in no time.</p>

<html><body><p>Many public radio shows offer podcasts of their episodes. But what is a podcast, and what does it mean to &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; to one? The hosts of Deemable Tech, Ray Hollister and Tom Braun, break it down in this week&rsquo;s Ask Deemable Tech.</p>
<p><script id="prx-p91007-embed" src="http://www.prx.org/p/91007/embed.js?size=full"></script></p>
<p>RAY: Hi, I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister, </p>
<p>TOM: I&rsquo;m Tom Braun, </p>
<p>RAY: and we&rsquo;re the hosts of Deemable Tech. On the show, we answer your questions about computers, tablets, mobile phones and the Internet, like this question we received from a listener:</p>
<p>TOM: Hey Ray &amp; Tom,</p>
<p>I have a question. What is a podcast? I listen to your show all the time on the website, and you keep saying to subscribe to the podcast. I hear other public radio shows talk about getting their podcast on the web too, but what is a podcast, and how do I &ldquo;subscribe&rdquo; to it? Are you going to mail it to my house or drop it off next to the newspaper? Forgive me for sounding stupid, but I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Subscribe me confused</p>
<p>RAY: Hey Subscribe me! Thanks for your email. Ooh, this is our first anonymous writer! Well, &ldquo;Subscribe me confused&rdquo;, you don&rsquo;t need to be anonymous if you are embarrassed for not knowing what a podcast is, and you&rsquo;re certainly not stupid for not knowing that. In fact, even your hosts here didn&rsquo;t know what a podcast was only a few years ago.</p>
<p>TOM: In fact, podcasts didn&rsquo;t even exist until as recently as 2005. A podcast is simply a broadcast to your media player. The term podcast is derived from the brand name, iPod, Apple&rsquo;s MP3 player, but that doesn&rsquo;t really matter now. Almost any device that can play music and/or videos can receive a podcast including most MP3 players, smartphones, and tablets.</p>
<p>RAY: Subscribing to a podcast means that you will automatically get the latest episode of the show that you listen to without you having to do anything. It works like On Demand works on your TV. You can listen or watch the podcast when and where you want to, and because it happens automatically, you don&rsquo;t have to remember to check the website to see if a new episode has been posted.</p>
<p>To subscribe to a podcast you need a program or app called a podcatcher; the most popular one is iTunes. To subscribe to a podcast in iTunes you can either search for the name of the podcast you are looking for like &ldquo;Deemable Tech,&rdquo; or you can click a special link that takes you right to the podcast in iTunes, like <a title="Subscribe to Deemable Tech in iTunes" href="http://dmbl.co/itunes" target="_blank">Deemable Tech&rsquo;s iTunes link</a>.. Then, iTunes will pull up the podcast listing and you can click &ldquo;Subscribe&rdquo; to have the podcast automatically downloaded to your computer or your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.</p>
<p>TOM: If you have an Android phone or a media player that isn&rsquo;t made by Apple, you can either use a program like <a title="Enjoy your Music, Video, Radio and iTunes on your Android" href="http://doubletwist.com/" target="_blank">DoubleTwist</a> to sync your device with iTunes, or you can use a different podcatcher like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts" target="_blank">Pocket Casts</a> or <a title="Talk radio, podcasts and live radio on demand | Stitcher Smart Radio" href="http://stitcher.com/" target="_blank">Stitcher</a> for Android or <a title="Juice, the cross-platform podcast receiver." href="http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Juice</a> for Windows, Mac or Linux. Other podcatcher apps may not have directories like iTunes does. In that case, you may need to know the RSS feed address of the show that you are looking for. Ours is <a href="http://dmbl.co/pod">http://dmbl.co/pod</a>.</p>
<p>RAY: If you love listening to public radio or talk radio, you will love podcasts. Almost all of your favorite radio shows on <a title="NPR podcasts" href="www.npr.org/rss/podcast/podcast_directory.php" target="_blank">NPR</a>, <a title="PRI: Public Radio International - PRI Podcasts" href="http://www.pri.org/pri-podcasts.html" target="_blank">PRI</a> and <a title="American Public Media: Podcasts" href="http://americanpublicmedia.publicradio.org/podcasts/" target="_blank">APM</a> and most <a title="Fox News Radio" href="http://radio.foxnews.com/podcast/" target="_blank">talk radio shows</a> have podcasts, and there are a plethora of shows, like Deemable Tech, that you might not find on your local radio station. Also, subscribing to the shows that you love helps support those shows. The more subscribers that a show has, the higher up that show will be listed in the iTunes podcast directory, which means that more listeners will find the show and start listening! So, go <a title="Subscribe to Deemable Tech in iTunes" href="http://dmbl.co/itunes" target="_blank">subscribe to Deemable Tech&rsquo;s podcast</a>, and then check out all of the other shows out there.</p>
<p>RAY: To hear more answers to questions like this one, listen to our show at Deemable dot com, that&rsquo;s D-E E-M A-B-L-E dot com. There you can listen to all of our previous episodes and, of course, subscribe to our podcast.</p>
<p>TOM: If you have a question for Deemable Tech give us a call us at 1-888-972-9868, or you can send us an email at questions@deemable.com.</p>
<p>RAY: For Deemable Tech I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister,</p>
<p>TOM: and I&rsquo;m Tom Braun.</p>
