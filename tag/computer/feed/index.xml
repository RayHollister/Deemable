<p><strong>Q:</strong> I often get a message from my laptop saying that the virtual memory is too low and that the computer will adjust it. Why is this happening almost four to five times a week?<span id="more-9396"></span></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Thanks for the question, Osler! Before we explain what &ldquo;virtual memory&rdquo; is, we&rsquo;re going to just go ahead and tell you what your problem is: your hard drive is too full. Consider uninstalling a few programs you no longer need on your laptop, and moving large multimedia files off of your computer and onto an external hard drive. Computer games and video files are especially notorious for taking up a lot of hard drive space.</p>
<div id="attachment_9397" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2014/11/ram_memory.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9397" src="//media/2014/11/ram_memory-300x225.jpg"  alt="Image credit: Wikimedia Commons" width="300" height="225"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Wikimedia Commons</p></div>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure what is eating up the most room on your computer, we recommend using a program called <a href="https://windirstat.info/" target="_blank">WinDirStat</a>. It does a fantastic job of showing you which files and programs are taking up the most space, so you can then delete the ones you don&rsquo;t need any more or move them to an external hard drive. Once you clear off some of those files, you should stop getting those annoying messages.</p>
<p>Now onto what virtual memory is. Your laptop has two main ways to store information: RAM (often referred to as &ldquo;memory&rdquo;) and the hard drive. Accessing the RAM is really fast, so your computer will try to store as many running programs and streaming videos as possible there.</p>
<p>The thing about RAM, though, is that you often don&rsquo;t have that much of it &ndash; your computer probably only has two, four or maybe eight gigabytes of it. When it comes to hard drive space, on the other hand, your computer may have 500 or even 1000 gigabytes of that. When your computer runs low on RAM, it will use the slower hard drive to augment the memory. This is known as virtual memory.</p>
<p>Basically, your computer carves off chunks of whatever it was try to put in the real memory, and puts it into the virtual memory on your hard drive instead. But this won&rsquo;t work very well if you&rsquo;re low on hard drive space. At that point, your system is constantly trying to swap things between the RAM and the hard dive in tiny bits, and your computer can really grind to a halt.</p>
<p>Windows will try to help you with this problem, which is when you are getting those messages, but it can&rsquo;t do anything if you just don&rsquo;t have enough free space on your hard drive. So, like we said, try clearing a few things off of it, and you should be back to normal.</p>

<p><strong>Q: </strong>Whenever I unplug my USB thumb drive, a warning pops up telling me that I didn&rsquo;t eject the drive, and it could cause damage if I don&rsquo;t eject it. I usually ignore this message and it hasn&rsquo;t caused me any issues yet. Is this really a problem?<span id="more-9008"></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2014/07/flash_drive.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9009" src="//media/2014/07/flash_drive-300x225.jpg"  alt="flash_drive" width="300" height="225"></a>A: </strong>We&rsquo;ll admit it, Hector, we&rsquo;ve occasionally done the same thing. There&rsquo;s nothing more irritating than waiting for a computer to eject a thumb drive when you&rsquo;ve got to be somewhere. What&rsquo;s worse is trying to eject a drive only to have the computer tell you that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;busy.&rdquo; Busy doing what? Getting a cup of coffee?</p>
<p>As annoying as it can be, the truth is you really should eject all USB devices before you unplug them. This is especially true for external hard drives, as the sudden loss of power can cause physical damage to the spinning discs inside them. That doesn&rsquo;t have to happen too many times for the hard drive to fail, taking all that data with it.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s just for USB <em>hard</em> drives. USB <em>flash</em> drives (or thumb drives as many people call them) use flash memory so they don&rsquo;t have any moving parts inside them. However, flash drives do have an important limitation: they only have a certain number of times they can be written to before they wear out. Each time a computer writes to a flash drive, that number decreases. To try to extend that lifespan, your computer will try to make fewer writes to the drive by grouping them all together.</p>
<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you decide to copy three different files to your flash drive. Instead of writing to your drive three separate times, Windows will hold onto them. Then when you tell Windows to eject that device, it will finish copying the files over, reducing three jobs down to one. This is where that &ldquo;busy&rdquo; warning comes in; Windows is letting you know that it needs to finish saving these files.</p>
<p>You may be wondering how long you can expect your flash drive to last. This varies based on the quality of the drive, so unfortunately there is no one true answer. However, high quality flash memory is rated to nearly one million writes, which translates to one use every day for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>Just remember, Hector: you must eject before you disconnect!</p>

<p>3-D Tri-Gate. While it might sound like a mix between Trident gum and the Watergate scandal, Tri-Gate is actually a revolutionary 3-D transistor designed by Intel that will soon be put into high-volume manufacturing. As the microscopic building block of modern electronics, transistors are semiconductor devices that are used to switch and amplify electronic signals.</p>
<p>For decades, the 2-D planar transistor structure has powered nearly every electronics device, and now, Intel has announced that it will be putting their new 3-D transistors into high-volume production at the 22-nanometer node in an Intel processor &ndash; simply known as &ldquo;Ivy Bridge&rdquo;. The Tri-Gate transistors will help Intel keep pace with Moore&rsquo;s Law, named after Intel&rsquo;s co-founder, Gordon Moore, which describes a trend in computing hardware in which the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit doubles nearly every two years. This is a <em>huge </em>breakthrough in transistor technology.</p>
<p>You may be asking, &ldquo;Why should I care?&rdquo; Well, the new 3-D Tri-Gate transistors will be <em>much</em> faster, <em>much</em> smaller, and consume up to 50% less power. Intel, the largest provider of PC processors, says that the new 3-D  transistors are so small that more than 100 million could fit on the  head of a pin. Ivy Bridge is also said to be 37% more efficient than the best  of Intel&rsquo;s current chips at low voltage, and could help Intel break  into the mobile arena of smartphones and tablets. Although the mass production of Ivy Bridge won&rsquo;t begin until later this   year or early next year, Intel began demonstrating prototypes of   computers and servers running the new 3-D chip yesterday at a news   conference. We are now witnessing the future of technology in transition!</p>
