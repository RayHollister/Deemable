<html><body><p><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2013/01/Windows8StickerShock.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6680 alignright" title="You better get Windows 8 now before the price goes up 500%!" alt="A receipt printer showing the Windows 8 logo on the receipt printing out and $199.99. " src="/media/2013/01/Windows8StickerShock-300x300.png"  width="300" height="300"></a>Windows 8 Pro, which has been available as an upgrade for Windows XP, Vista and 7 users for only $39.99, will be jumping in price up to $199.99 after January 31st. The standard Windows 8 will be available for $119.99. However, if you purchased a Windows 7 PC after June 2nd of last year but before January 31st of this year, you have until February 28th to register for the Windows Upgrade Offer to receive the upgrade for $14.99. After that date, you&rsquo;ll have to pay full price too if you decide to upgrade to Windows 8.</p>
<p>Why the 500% increase? The $39.99 was never intended to be permanent; it was a special offer to encourage early adoption. Depending on how you look at it, that may or may not have been successful. According to a report by web metrics firm <a href="http://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&amp;qpcustomd=0">Net Applications </a> Windows 8 market share in December grew by 57% over November&rsquo;s totals.</p>
<p>However that still leaves Windows 8 in 7th place in market share at a dismal 1.72%. This leaves Windows 8 trailing far behind Windows 7 at approximately 45%, Windows XP at 39% and even Windows Vista at 5% and Mac OS X 10.8, 10.7 and 10.6 at about 2% each. Compared to one month after Windows 7&rsquo;s launch, Windows 8&rsquo;s activation rate has been significantly lower, and Windows 7 did not have a drastic introductory price to drive sales. Time will tell of this is too soon to bring the price of Windows 8 up, or if consumers just decide that new operating system isn&rsquo;t worth the higher price.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been on the fence about upgrading to Windows 8, the time to make up your mind is now. If you wait until February 1st, you&rsquo;ll have to pay an $80 or $160 procrastination fee. However, if you feel the same way the guy in this video feels, maybe it&rsquo;s worth the wait. Caution, some language NSFW.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think that Windows 8 will continue to grow in market share and over take Windows 7 and XP, or do you think that Windows 8 is going to be left out in the cold, especially after the price jump? Will Windows 8 be the new Windows Vista? Let us know in the comments down below.</strong></p>
