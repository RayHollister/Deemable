<h3>Facebook ?Likes&rsquo; rumors of a ?Dislike&rsquo; button</h3>
<p>Pretty much ever since Facebook introduced its ubiquitous ?like&rsquo; button, users have been clamoring for a ?dislike&rsquo; button. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-is-working-on-a-disklike-button-2015-9&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNESLWUmoJTSDf2YlombZDDSLHvrEg">Well last month, Business Insider reported that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had announced that the company was working on one</a>. Only, it isn&rsquo;t quite what you think.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, the world&rsquo;s most dominant social media site isn&rsquo;t about to turn into a den of passive-aggressive backstabbing &ndash; anymore than it already is. Zuck says he wants to give users a way to express sympathy or empathy when someone posts that they are having a bad day or going through a difficult time.</p>
<p>While Facebook&rsquo;s CEO promised that the ?dislike&rsquo; button would appear in the not-too-distant future, as of this recording it is not available. And you should be wary of scams. Gizmodo reports that <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://factually.gizmodo.com/dont-fall-for-the-facebook-dislike-button-scam-1732352168&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBMDi-u-SLQOrXd3yHLTFDe5Y_9Q">ads have started appearing promising that people that take a survey can get early access to the ?dislike&rsquo; button</a>. You can&rsquo;t and you won&rsquo;t. Although you may ?dislike&rsquo; what happens to you if you try.</p>
<h3>The internet gives ?Yelp for Humans&rsquo; a one star rating</h3>
<p>Ever app developer hopes that their app will go viral and gain massive media attention. Last week, one soon-to-be-released app did, although probably not in the way its creators wanted. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/09/30/everyone-you-know-will-be-able-to-rate-you-on-the-terrifying-yelp-for-people-whether-you-want-them-to-or-not/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7yS9IfdLogqgONJkV9u7RSiAIHg">The Washington Post ran a story about an app called Peeple</a>, which founder Julia Cordray billed as ?Yelp for Humans&rsquo;. Supposedly the app would allow you to rate anyone you had a phone # on a 1-5 scale. The people you were rating did not have to be signed up for the app.</p>
<p>Although Cordray promised that there would be controls in place to prevent cyber-bullying and that those who received negative ratings would have 48 hours to respond to them before they were posted, the internet backlash was swift and massive. Within hours, #Peeple was a trending topic on Twitter, with the Tweets about it almost uniformly negative. Peeple&rsquo;s Facebook page was flooded with angry comments. Ironically, Peeple began to delete negative feedback from their Facebook page before taking both it and their Twitter feed offline entirely.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://m.snopes.com/2015/10/01/peeple/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNFkmBDPXjHBSVr6ewJ_mOFVVD_LQg">Snopes.com speculated that Peeple was actually just a hoax</a>&nbsp;intended to rile everyone up. However, there has been no confirmation that it is in fact a hoax at this time.</p>
<p>As of this morning, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/julia-cordray-ceo-peeple-creating-worlds-largest-app-julia-cordray&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqHOZ-BYwSxqCZOtmk-ONuTn1-lg">Peeple founder Julia Cordray has posted a lengthy ?clarification&rsquo; on LinkedIn</a>. In her article, she claims that the purpose of the app has been misunderstood, that it is a ?positivity&rsquo; app, and that it will NOT in fact allow negative reviews or allow reviews of people who have not signed up for the app. This seems directly contradictory to what has been stated about the app before, including in a handful of ?webisodes&rsquo; that the team had posted on YouTube.</p>
<p>A further wrinkle in this crazy only-on-the-internet story: Peeple is also the name of another startup, this one a company which has developed an electronic, wifi-enabled peephole for your front-door. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.wired.com/2015/10/peeple-the-thing-versus-peeple-the-app/&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPayX-_WOeKBTXppsfcnYARZwssQ">Wired reports that the other Peeple is less-than-pleased about the unwanted publicity</a>. Since the other Peeple owns the trademark to the name in the US, it is not clear how the app makers will proceed. Should they choose to, their stated release date is in November.</p>
<h2>Random guy buys Google.com from Google for $12</h2>
<p>Mashable reports <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mashable.com/2015/10/01/buys-google-com-for-12/?utm_cid%3Dmash-com-fb-main-link%236tNOquWWjqq1&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzZ2yglbX9reJn1UDSYCMOu2z6Iw">that last week a random guy was able to buy Google.com </a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mashable.com/2015/10/01/buys-google-com-for-12/?utm_cid%3Dmash-com-fb-main-link%236tNOquWWjqq1&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzZ2yglbX9reJn1UDSYCMOu2z6Iw">from Google</a><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mashable.com/2015/10/01/buys-google-com-for-12/?utm_cid%3Dmash-com-fb-main-link%236tNOquWWjqq1&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzZ2yglbX9reJn1UDSYCMOu2z6Iw">&nbsp;for the massive price of $12</a>. Sanmay Ved, a student at Babson University, was playing around with Google Domains when he noticed that the site said that &ldquo;Google.com&rdquo; was unclaimed. He added it to his cart, checked out, and a few minutes later had an email informing him of his successful purchase of &ldquo;Google.com.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just a few minutes after that, however, his purchase was mysteriously cancelled. Ved reports that he did notify Google of the glitch after the fact. No word on why Google had its own domain up for sale in the first place.</p>
<p>Mashable notes that Microsoft lost Hotmail.co.uk in a similar glitch in 2003, but had more trouble getting it back.</p>
<h2>Amazon.com to stop carrying competing streaming devices Chromecast and Apple TV</h2>
<p>Competition in the world of streaming TV and movies continues to heat up. Several different companies now offer low-cost solutions that allow users to stream high quality video from several different services on the cheap. The leaders are Google&rsquo;s Chromecast, Apple&rsquo;s Apple TV, and Amazon&rsquo;s Fire TV Stick. Well <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/amazon-will-ban-sale-of-apple-google-video-streaming-devices&amp;sa=D&amp;usg=AFQjCNEkxlNaEuhFqa8g2WgV67q9_QKZvw">Bloomberg reports that Amazon.com has decided that that is a few competitors too many</a>. It has announced that starting on October 29th it will no longer carry either the Chromecast or the AppleTV in its online store. Just in time for the Christmas season!</p>
<p>Amazon states that the reason for this move is that its competitor&rsquo;s devices don&rsquo;t &ldquo;interact well&rdquo; with Amazon Prime Video. Of course it would appear that it is up to Amazon to develop software for the devices, not the companies that make them.</p>
<p>Other streaming devices, including Roku&rsquo;s set top device and Microsoft&rsquo;s XBox One and Sony&rsquo;s Playstation 4 are not affected</p>

<p><strong>Q: </strong>What is the best way to hook my laptop up to my TV?<span id="more-8497"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_8498" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://deemable.com/media/2013/12/laptop_to_tv.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8498" src="//media/2013/12/laptop_to_tv-300x250.png"  alt="Image Credit: Alan Levine / Flickr" width="300" height="250"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Alan Levine / Flickr</p></div>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Thinking of cutting the cord, Aaron? With Netflix and Hulu Plus you can get most of the shows you watch on TV without cable. Or maybe you want to use your TV to show the baby videos stored on your laptop? Either way there are a few options.</p>
<p>If you have an HDMI port on both your laptop and your TV, the simplest approach may be to connect them using an HDMI cable. Most, but not all, laptops now support HDMI and virtually every modern TV does. A word of caution: don&rsquo;t go to your local big box store to buy HDMI cables &ndash; they are way overpriced! You can find them online for literally a quarter of the price (we&rsquo;re talking $10 vs. $40).</p>
<p>Once you have a cable connecting both the laptop and the TV, you need to select the HDMI input on your television. Then, if you are using a PC, you may have to tell your laptop to send the signal to the TV. This is usually accomplished by pressing the &ldquo;function&rdquo; or &ldquo;FN&rdquo; key and one of the F keys at the top of the keyboard.</p>
<p>Now, if you don&rsquo;t want to cover your living room with HDMI cables, there are also a lot of wireless solutions out there. However, your choices depend on what kind of laptop you have and what you want to do with it. For instance, Intel has a very nice bit of technology to mirror your PC or Mac called WiDi (which stands for &ldquo;Wireless Display&rdquo;). Unfortunately it is not very widely available, and typically you&rsquo;ll only find it on high-end Intel laptops.</p>
<p>Several manufacturers also make small boxes which enable wireless streaming from your laptop to your television. Apple TV and Roku are two of the most widely known. Either one can stream from a Mac or PC, and from Netflix, Hulu Plus and a variety of other services. They each cost around $100 (depending on which version of the Roku you buy). If we were answering your question six months ago, we would tell you to get one of these.</p>
<p>You see, there&rsquo;s now another solution that&rsquo;s a lot cheaper. Google sells a small gadget called the Chromecast which plugs into the HDMI port on your TV. It then connects to your home WiFi network. Once it&rsquo;s set up, you can stream video from your laptop through the Google Chrome browser (it supports YouTube, Netflix, Hulu Plus and Pandora), and it will mirror any page you have open in the browser. And here&rsquo;s kicker: it&rsquo;s only $30.</p>
<p>However, you should know that there are some limitations. Since the Chromecast only streams what you can view through the Chrome browser, it most likely won&rsquo;t work with video you have stored locally on your hard drive. So, it may not be the best solution if you are looking to show off your baby videos.</p>
<p>But, again, for $30 it may be worth a shot. If it doesn&rsquo;t work out, there&rsquo;s always the HDMI cable.</p>

<html><body><p>If you still haven&rsquo;t purchased your <strong>special someone</strong> a present for Valentine&rsquo;s Day, your <strong>sweet-heart</strong> is a gadget junkie, and there&rsquo;s an electronics store on the way home, this article might help you from spending the night snuggled up with Fido. Here&rsquo;s a list of eleven tech gifts under $100 (and one at $129) that will make great last-minute Valentine&rsquo;s Day presents.</p>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>iPod shuffle &ndash; $49</h3>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iPodShuffleAllColors.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-4921 alignleft" title="I see your true colors, and that's why I love you..." src="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iPodShuffleAllColors-150x150.jpg"  alt="All of the colors of the iPod shuffle" width="135" height="135"></a>The iPod shuffle is a great gift for folks who work out a lot, take the dog for long walks, or who lose things easily. At only $49, it is the cheapest device from Apple that you can buy for your <strong>sweetie pie</strong>, but the sacrifice is that she&rsquo;ll only be able to put about 350 songs on the 2GB of internal storage. Just make sure that she didn&rsquo;t mean to say &ldquo;<a title="Apple - iPod touch - Now in white. It has fun written all over it." href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/" target="_blank">iPod touch</a>&rdquo; (the iPod shuffle&rsquo;s more expensive, touch-screen cousin) when she said she wanted an iPod, or the iPod shuffle might be the <em>only</em> thing you get to touch on Valentine&rsquo;s.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Jawbone Up &ndash; $99.99</h3>
<h3><a href="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/JawboneUp-e1328748635428.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-4901 alignleft" title='Jawbone Up - The tech gadget that says "Get up, (get on up) Get up, (get on up) Stay on the scene, (get on up), like a..."' src="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/JawboneUp-300x150.jpg"  alt="Jawbone Up" width="180" height="90"></a></h3>
<p>Available in black, white, red, blue and silver, the Jawbone up is more than just another rubbery bracelet that looks like it stole its design from Lance Armstrong&rsquo;s <a title="LIVESTRONG.COM - Lose Weight &amp; Get Fit with Diet, Nutrition &amp; Fitness Tools" href="http://www.livestrong.com/" target="_blank">LIVESTRONG</a> campaign. The Jawbone Up has a motion sensor inside that monitors your <strong>dearest one&rsquo;s</strong> activity during the day and sleep at night. Then, it syncs with and displays all that information on an app on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. During the day, the Jawbone Up will keep track of how many steps your <strong>stud muffin</strong> takes, calculate how many calories he burned, and he can set it to remind him to get up and get moving when he&rsquo;s been staring at the computer screen for too long. At night, it keeps track of how long it took him to fall asleep, how many hours he slept, and how much of it was light or deep sleep. In the morning, the Jawbone Up will silently wake your <strong>Prince Charming</strong> with the Smart Alarm. The Smart Alarm wakes him up at the ideal point in his sleep cycle just before his desired wake up time by gently vibrating on his wrist. You&rsquo;re <strong>sugar pie</strong> will wake up feeling like a million bucks, and you&rsquo;ll get to sleep in!</p>

<h3>iPod nano &ndash; $129</h3>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iPodNanoWatch.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4925" title="Her girlfriends will ask her, 'Is that an iPod nano on your wrist or does your man just love you more than mine loves me?'" src="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iPodNanoWatch-e1328757231886-150x150.jpg"  alt="iPod Nano with a red watch band and Minnie Mouse watch face." width="150" height="150"></a>For an extra eighty dollars over the price of the iPod shuffle, the iPod nano offers a lot more bang for your buck. Starting at 8 GB, it can hold around 1,400 songs, and it has a multi-touch, color screen. Additionally, it has a built-in accelerometer and it works with Nike + iPod compatible cardio machines to keep track of all of your <strong>buttercup&rsquo;s</strong> workouts. It also has an FM radio that she can pause, rewind and fast forward live radio, and with one of the many third-party wristbands available it makes a nifty watch with 18 different watch faces.</p>

<h3>Apple TV &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/TVappleTVandRemote.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4934" title="Apple TV" src="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/appletv.jpg"  alt="" width="130" height="130"></a>With an Apple TV, your <strong>cuddly-wuddly</strong> can watch or listen to anything in his iTunes account, stream Netflix, Vimeo, and YouTube videos and watch live sports from the NBA, NFL and NHL. With the airplay feature, he can stream anything from his iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to the big screen of his home television. Another benefit is its simple and easy set up; your guy can start enjoying the Apple TV right away when he invites you over tonight for a movie and snuggle session.</p>

<h3>Roku 2 XS &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Roku2_XS_Remote.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4959" src="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Roku2_XS_Remote-300x225.jpg"  alt="Roku2 XS with Remote" width="162" height="122"></a>If your <strong>snuggle-bear</strong> isn&rsquo;t an Apple fanboy, but he would still like to watch video from the Internet on his big screen TV, another great option is the Roku 2 XS, which offers some of the same features, including the NBA, NHL, and Netflix, but also includes more features like Amazon Instant Video, Pandora, Hulu Plus and even Angry Birds; however, it doesn&rsquo;t support Air Play or iTunes. Another benefit of the Roku 2 XS over the Apple TV is that it is backwards compatible with older televisions. So, even if your <strong>hunk</strong> doesn&rsquo;t have a high-definition TV, he can still invite you over to watch <a title="Netflix - The English Patient" href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=477351&amp;trkid=4451748&amp;t=The+English+Patient" target="_blank">The English Patient</a> on Netflix.</p>

<h3>iPhone 4 &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iphone4-black.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4945" title="It doesn't have Siri, but it's not too shabby." src="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iphone4-black.png"  alt="iPhone 4" width="150" height="150"></a>The Apple iPhone 4 is great for the girlfriend who is disorganized and perpetually running late for the special dates you plan. It may not be an iPhone 4S, but at $99 the iPhone 4 won&rsquo;t break the bank either. With easy scheduling and reminders, great games, and FaceTime for late-night romantic chats with your <strong>darling</strong>, the iPhone 4 is an excellent all-in-one gadget for last-minute gift-givers. If your honey is an Android fan, there is also a plethora of <a title="Android Central | Phones Category | Sorted by Price" href="https://wl-androidcentral.bbymsolutions.com/category/phones?navCode=4tDTVKmeZ9&amp;sort=lowPrice&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Android smart phones available for $99 or less</a>.</p>

<h3>Kindle &ndash; $79 &amp; Kindle Touch &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Kindle-Touch-store-e1328762980318.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-4948" title="Toucha toucha toucha touch me, I wanna be..." src="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Kindle-Touch-store-e1328762980318-150x150.jpg"  alt="Kindle Touch" width="150" height="150"></a><a href="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/kindlejeans.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4995" style="margin: 10px;" title="Kindle e-Reader - Don't take it the wrong way, but it wants to get into your jeans." src="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/kindlejeans-e1329190497112-150x150.jpg"  alt="Kindle e-Reader" width="120" height="120"></a>If your <strong>beloved</strong> is a bookworm, the Kindle (on the right) or Kindle touch (on the left) are both excellent choices. The Kindle Touch is light, fast, and small with a touchscreen and audio features, although books can only be downloaded when wi-fi connected, and at this price it is ad-supported. The regular Kindle is lighter and skinnier than its Touch counterpart and has the same size screen, but getting around the menus requires using a directional pad, and it doesn&rsquo;t play music or audio books. If she loves to read but complains that she can&rsquo;t find the time, she may not even know how much she would enjoy this device. It is very convenient to find new books in the Kindle bookstore, and she may find the time to read once she has a device that fits easily in her purse or her back pocket.</p>

<h3>Nook Simple Touch &ndash; $99</h3>

The Nook boasts that it is 25% faster than any other reader, and it does not have any ads; however, it does not have a web browser, and, like the regular Kindle, it does not play music or audio books.</p>

<h3>Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750 &ndash; $59.99</h3>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Logitech_K750.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4956" title="Sunshine on my keyboard keeps it charged up..." src="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Logitech_K750-300x165.jpg"  alt="Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750" width="168" height="92"></a>If your <strong>heartthrob</strong>&nbsp;is always busy blogging, the Logitech solar keyboard is the perfect choice. It&rsquo;s green technology requires no batteries, no wires, and offers easy setup. This is a gadget that will make your man&rsquo;s life easier and his desk more streamlined. It runs on&nbsp;Windows&reg; XP, Windows Vista&reg;, Windows&reg; 7 and Mac OS&reg; X 10.4. It reportedly works on most flavors of Linux too, but it&rsquo;s not specifically supported.</p>

<h3>Powermat &ndash; $79.99</h3>

<p>For the <strong>hunk</strong> who already has all the gadgets that he wants, the perfect Valentine&rsquo;s gift is a wireless charging mat called the Powermat. As a former Palm Pre owner, I miss being able to just set my phone down on the Touchstone and charge it without having to plug it in. With the Powermat and a matching&nbsp;receiver door, almost any device can work just like my Pre did. The Powermat simplifies the charging process and cuts down visual cord clutter for a guy who juggles several electronic devices. Plus, it&rsquo;s just really cool.</p>

<h3>OtterBox &ndash; $19.95 &ndash; 49.955</h3>
<p><a href="http://deemable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Otterbox.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4961" title="Don't go breaking my phone.

One of the best of device-protecting accessories is the OtterBox. These range in price (Defender Series $49.95, Reflex Series $34.95, Commuter Series $34.95, Impact Series $19.95), but are well worth the extra dollar spent when her device accidentally goes flying off the couch and hits the floor during an intense snuggling session with your <strong>mamacita</strong>.</p>
