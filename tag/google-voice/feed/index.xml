<p><strong>Q:</strong> Here&rsquo;s a question about a lower-tech gadget. I have a Panasonic cordless telephone with a digital answering machine. Over the years, it has collected several messages that I&rsquo;d like to archive. I don&rsquo;t see any inputs or outputs for doing this. Is there a way to permanently store the messages on this answering machine digitally?<span id="more-9483"></span></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Your question would be a lot easier to answer if your phone wasn&rsquo;t cordless. If your phone had a cord on it,&nbsp;you would only&nbsp;have to buy a <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/mini-recorder-control/4301237.html" target="_blank">mini recorder control from RadioShack</a>&nbsp;to connect it directly to your computer or recorder so that you could record from it. But, there are three different ways that you can extract the voicemails from the answering machine.</p>
<h3>The Caveman Way (or The Obvious Way)</h3>
<p>Since it is cordless, you&rsquo;ll have to transfer the messages wirelessly, using the oldest form of wireless communication: sound. Hold a the microphone of a recorder up to speaker of your answering machine. Press Record on the recorder, and press Play on the answering machine. Ta da! You have a mildly listenable digital recording.</p>
<h3>The MacGyver Way (or The Hacker Way)</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling a little handy, there is a another method&nbsp;that will give&nbsp;you a higher&nbsp;quality recording. (Disclaimer: This will <em>destroy</em> your answering machine. It will never function in the way it was intended to function again. You could also lose all of your voicemails&nbsp;in the process.&nbsp;Proceed with caution. Also, you may want to try recording them &ldquo;The Caveman&nbsp;Way&rdquo; first, just in case.)</p>
<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to get a <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/12-ft-24-gauge-speaker-cable-with-1-8-plug/4202454.html#?CID=ip:Affiliate:RSO:VigLink&amp;clickid=0byzZu2fn0VIWsJQK32o23WyUkV2nl2NQ3LkRA0" target="_blank">speaker cable with a&nbsp;? inch plug on one side and two bare wires</a> on the other end. You need it to be long enough to reach from your answering machine to the back of your computer or to your recorder.</p>
<p>Once you have the wire, you&rsquo;ll need to open the answering machine case. It usually only takes a few screws to open the case.</p>
<p>Now, look for the speaker. You may be able to see where the speaker before you open the case. It&rsquo;s where the sound is coming out of the case.</p>
<p>Now that you have the case open, and you have found the speaker, you should see two wires&nbsp;connected to the speaker. Cut or remove them from the speaker.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Master-a-perfect-inline-wire-splice-everytime/" target="_blank">Splice the wires</a> from the answering machine together with the speaker cable. Never spliced wires before? Check out the previous link for a guide from Instructables.</p>
<p>Finally, plug the&nbsp;? plug into the microphone port on your computer or recording device.</p>
<p>Now, if you are recording on your computer, fire up recording software like <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a> or <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/" target="_blank">GarageBand</a>&nbsp;and press record. If you&rsquo;re using a recording device, just press record. Then, press Play on the answering machine.</p>
<p>If you did everything right, you should be getting&nbsp;a digital recording of your voicemails that sounds better than anything you could have recorded &ldquo;The Caveman Way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t do everything right, then you have a useless pile&nbsp;of plastic and circuit board. Sorry about that!</p>
<h3>The Safer&nbsp;Way (or The Nerdy Way)</h3>
<p>Since your answering machine is a digital machine, it likely has a remote access feature. Find the manual for your answering machine,&nbsp;(Yeah, right. You can <a href="http://www.panasonic.com/uk/consumer/home-phones/telephones-with-answering-machine.html" target="_blank">look up the manual for your answering machine on Panasonic&rsquo;s website</a>.) and find the instructions on how to access your answering machine remotely.</p>
<p>Once you know how to access it remotely, use&nbsp;a service like <a href="https://support.google.com/voice/answer/115082?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Voice&nbsp;to record the call</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Isabel writes, &ldquo;I have an iPhone and an iPad. Is it possible to message or text someone who does not have an Apple product? And, if that?s too easy for you guys, how about this: is there any way to do it for free without a texting plan?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-9495-1" preload="none" style="width: 100%; visibility: hidden;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="http://cpa.ds.npr.org/wjct/audio/2015/07/adt_20150702_text_over_wifi.mp3?_=1"></source><a href="http://cpa.ds.npr.org/wjct/audio/2015/07/adt_20150702_text_over_wifi.mp3">http://cpa.ds.npr.org/wjct/audio/2015/07/adt_20150702_text_over_wifi.mp3</a></audio><p>It?s totally possible. The simplest way is if both you and the person you are trying to message are using a cross-platform messaging app (one that works on both Android and iOS). There are several apps that you can use to send short text messages over Wi-Fi like Kik, WhatsApp and even Facebook Messenger. The two major problems with all of them is that you can only send messages to people who are also on the same service, and you cannot use them to send regular old SMS text messages.</p>
<p>The best app that we have found that actually sends real text messages is Google Voice. With Google Voice, you can send text messages from the app on your iDevice or from the Google Voice website. It takes a little while to setup, but it?s completely free.</p>
<p>The main catch is that Google Voice gives you a new phone number for your Google Voice account for free. Once you pick it out, you can use that number to make phone calls, send text messages, and receive them too ? as long as you?re on Wi-Fi or cellular data. You can text anyone in the U.S. and Canada, and you can receive texts from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The simplest way to get started is to go to the Google voice website. Login with your Google email address if you have one, and then click ?Get a voice number? on the left and follow the instructions. When it asks you to ?add a forwarding phone? you will need to tell it the phone number of your existing cell phone. Google will actually make a robo-call to your phone and give you an activation code to verify that your number belongs to you. Once that is all set up, download the Google Voice app and start texting.</p>
<p>We should once again note that Google Voice is not a cellular service. If you don?t have an internet connect through Wi-Fi or a wireless provider you will not be able to use it.</p>
