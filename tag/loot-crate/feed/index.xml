<html><body><p>If you spend a lot of time on social media, you may have noticed a fair number of ads for subscription boxes on your feed. The trend of companies offering monthly packs of curated products has steadily grown over the past several years, and you can now find sites offering boxes of everything from specialty dog treats to designer makeup shipped directly to your door. I&rsquo;ve always wondered how well these services work and if they&rsquo;re worth the price, so I decided to try some of them out.</p>
<p><span id="more-9185"></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What Is It?</span></strong></p>
<p>The first subscription box I&rsquo;m reviewing (chosen at random) is <a href="https://www.lootcrate.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Loot Crate</strong></a>, which according to their website is a &ldquo;monthly gear and swag club for those that live and embrace the geek and gaming lifestyle.&rdquo; This box (or crate, as they call it) is aimed at fans of such things as comic books, video games and superhero movies. I fit squarely into this demographic (read: I&rsquo;m a geek).</p>
<div id="attachment_9186" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/media/2014/09/lootcrate_july.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-9186" src="/media/2014/09/lootcrate_july.jpg"  alt="Loot Crate's July 2014 &quot;villains&quot; box.

Check out those awesome Deadpool socks. Image credit: Loot Crate</p></div>
<p>Each month, Loot Crate ships a &ldquo;product discovery&rdquo; box filled with items like toys, shirts and gadgets picked by their staff and centered around a particular theme. For example, the &ldquo;villains&rdquo; themed crate for July 2014 (seen above) included among other things a Joker shirt, a Darth Vader keychain and a pair of Deadpool socks. They often use a lot of licensed products from popular brands like Marvel, DC, Nintendo and Star Wars, so their crates usually offer broad appeal.</p>
<p>Loot Crate provided me with their August 2014 box to review. Following the previous month&rsquo;s &ldquo;villains&rdquo; theme, this one was appropriately centered around &ldquo;heroes.&rdquo;</p>
<div id="attachment_9187" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/media/2014/09/lootcrate_august.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-9187" src="/media/2014/09/lootcrate_august.jpg"  alt="Loot Crate's August 2014 &quot;heroes&quot; box.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What&rsquo;s In It?</span></strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Funko Pop! Guardians of the Galaxy Groot bobblehead doll</strong> &ndash; Funko&rsquo;s Pop! line of vinyl figures and bobbleheads consists of super cute versions of many popular characters &ndash; everything from Disney princesses to horror movie icons &ndash; &nbsp;that have giant heads and huge eyes. Groot, if you don&rsquo;t know, is one of the characters from Marvel&rsquo;s <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> comic and blockbuster movie. Put these two things together, and you have one adorable bobblehead. As an added bonus,&nbsp;this Loot Crate exclusive version of the figure glows in the dark.</li>
</ul><blockquote><p><em>Sidebar: I have to say that I would have liked this box even more if it were themed entirely around Groot. I <strong>love</strong> Groot. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about the character before seeing the film, but now I can&rsquo;t get enough of him. I would have been on board for a full &ldquo;Groot Crate&rdquo; (I&rsquo;ll be here all week!).</em></p></blockquote>
<ul><li><strong>Kidrobot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Ooze Action mini-figure</strong> &ndash; Based on the Nickelodeon show, these <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle</em> figures are about three inches tall, have disproportionately large heads and include their weapons of choice as accessories. Each box included a random choice out of the four Turtles; I received Raphael and his trusty twin sai. These figures are also glow-in-the-dark.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sunglasses</strong> &ndash; These glasses, made to look like the Turtles&rsquo; trademark bandannas, were also different with each box. Because I&rsquo;m color blind, I assumed the pair I got were red to go along with the Raphael figure. However, my Deemable Tech colleagues have informed me that they are in fact supposed to be Michelangelo&rsquo;s orange mask. Either way, I&rsquo;m wearing them as I type this.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Shwings</strong> &ndash; These &ldquo;wings for your shoes&rdquo; accessories come in a variety of shapes and colors, and you attach them to your shoes by lacing through them. I received a gold foil pair of lightning bolts that kind of remind me of The Flash, but sadly don&rsquo;t make me run any faster.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Video game air freshener</strong> &ndash; Again, it appears that which air freshener was in your box was chosen at random. The picture on Loot Crate&rsquo;s site shows a Mega Man themed one. I received a Sonic the Hedgehog air freshener in the shape of the hedgehog himself. The packaging lists the fragrance&nbsp;as being &ldquo;Sonic Breeze,&rdquo; which reminds me of a&nbsp;&ldquo;fresh rain&rdquo; or &ldquo;mountain stream&rdquo; scent. I have to wonder, though, do they mean this is what it smells like when Sonic runs past you? If so, that adds a whole new layer to those games.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>&ldquo;Digital loot&rdquo; card</strong> &ndash; This card includes three codes for various apps and PC games: a full Steam download code for the PC game <em>Defense Grid: The Awakening</em>; a special character unlock code for the <em>Doctor Who Legacy</em> app; and a special level unlock code for the PC game <em>Gauntlet</em>.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Deadpool magnet</strong> &ndash; Based on the world of Marvel&rsquo;s Deadpool (aka Wade Wilson aka the Merc with a Mouth), this magnet was designed&nbsp;to look like a box of &ldquo;Wilson&rsquo;s Chimichang&rsquo;Os&rdquo; cereal, &ldquo;the breakfast of anti-heroes!&rdquo; What are &ldquo;Chimichang&rsquo;Os,&rdquo; you ask? Well, they appear to be chimichangas&nbsp;in a bowl of milk. That&rsquo;s Deadpool for you.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Loot Crate button</strong> &ndash; A special button for this month&rsquo;s theme includes an illustration of heroes like Mega Man, Captain America and Batman.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Loot Crate magazine</strong> &ndash; This booklet features&nbsp;articles and activities tailored to each month&rsquo;s theme (among others, the August one included an article on the origins of several popular comic book and video game heroes). It also contains descriptions of all of the items in the crate.</li>
</ul><p>Loot Crate&rsquo;s box is about the size of a small shoe box, so I was surprised by the amount of stuff they were able to fit in it. The inside of the box is designed (at least for this month) to resemble the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&rsquo; sewer home, and served pretty well as a display for the TMNT mini-figure.</p>

<a href="/media/2014/09/loot_crate_3.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img width="150" height="150" src="/media/2014/09/loot_crate_3-150x150.jpg"  class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="loot_crate_3" data-attachment-id="9190" data-orig-file="/media/2014/09/loot_crate_3.jpg" data-orig-size="1000,747" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"2.4","credit":"","camera":"iPad mini","caption":"","created_timestamp":"1408642446","copyright":"","focal_length":"3.3","iso":"125","shutter_speed":"0.0416666666667","title":""}' data-image-title="loot_crate_3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="/media/2014/09/loot_crate_3-300x224.jpg" data-large-file="/media/2014/09/loot_crate_3.jpg"></a>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Much Does It Cost?</span></strong></p>
<p>Loot Crate offers three choices of subscription plans:</p>
<ul><li>Recurring one month subscription for $19.37 per month (includes shipping and handling).</li>
</ul><ul><li>Recurring three month plan for a total of $55.11 up front (includes shipping and handling).</li>
</ul><ul><li>Recurrently six month plan for a total of $105.99 up front (includes shipping and handling).</li>
</ul><p>Loot Crate advertises that the products in each box have a total retail value of $40 or more. From my calculations, this crate had at least $70 worth of items (based on current Amazon.com prices). Subscribers are also entered into a monthly drawing for a &ldquo;Mega Crate&rdquo; valued at over $750.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Verdict</span></strong></p>
<p>Part of the allure of this type of &ldquo;mystery box&rdquo; subscription is the surprise factor of not knowing what you&rsquo;re going to get. Unfortunately, that surprise factor can also mean your satisfaction with the the box could&nbsp;vary from month to month depending on your personal taste. While I really liked the selection in this Loot Crate box, I can imagine not being interested in another month&rsquo;s theme or items. Because of that, I don&rsquo;t know if I could ever commit to one of the more expensive plans they offer (especially since you have to pay for it all at once). I would, however, consider paying for the monthly subscription.</p>
<p>Overall, I was quite satisfied&nbsp;with Loot Crate. I would recommend it for anyone who likes this particular&nbsp;slice of pop culture, or enjoys these types of collectibles. For the price and the value of the items included, I think it is a good deal.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re reading this,&nbsp;Loot Crate: please consider my &ldquo;Groot Crate&rdquo; idea, OK?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you now with a picture of me wearing those Shwings.</p>
