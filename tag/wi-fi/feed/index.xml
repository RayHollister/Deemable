<p>It sounds like it wasn?t entirely the kid&rsquo;s fault, though. There&rsquo;s a new feature in iOS 9 called <strong>Wi-Fi Assist</strong> that was at least partially responsible.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi Assist helps to make sure you have a solid data connection when you&rsquo;re using Wi-Fi, even if your Wi-Fi connection is really weak. For example, if you&rsquo;re in a part of your house that is far away from your wireless router, Wi-Fi Assist will automatically switch your phone over to 4G cellular data to keep you connected to the internet.</p>
<p>This is great for people who have unlimited data plans, but it could run up your bill pretty quickly if you have a data cap and you&rsquo;re not paying attention to how much you&rsquo;re using.</p>
<hr><p>For tips on keeping your data usage low, check out our other articles <a href="//2013/04/michelle-asks-how-can-i-lower-my-data-usage-on-my-iphone/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="//2014/09/angela-asks-can-monthly-usage-smartphone/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="//2015/05/ask-deemable-tech-why-am-i-using-so-much-data/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<hr><p style="text-align: left;">If you&rsquo;re worried about Wi-Fi Assist eating up your data, here&rsquo;s how to turn it off:</p>
<ul><li style="text-align: left;">Open the Settings app</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Tap Cellular</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Scroll all the to the bottom of that menu</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Tap the toggle button next to Wi-Fi Assist</li>
</ul><p>In the Cellular menu, you&rsquo;ll also see a list of all of the apps on your phone that use cellular data. Next to each one is a toggle button to turn data for it on or off. It&rsquo;s a good idea to look through this list to see if there are any using data that don&rsquo;t need to be, especially ones you rarely use anymore.</p></body></html>

<html><body><p>Every once in a while we like to cover something everyone should know, and this time we wanted to talk about securing your personal information &ndash; on your smartphone.<span id="more-8932"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_8956" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/media/2014/06/iphone_5s_fingerprint.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8956" src="/media/2014/06/iphone_5s_fingerprint-300x210.jpg"  alt="Image credit: Kelvinsong / Wikimedia" width="300" height="210"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image credit: Kelvinsong / Wikimedia</p></div>
<p>If you own a smartphone, you probably keep tons of personal information on it: your address book, emails, passwords, maybe even credit card data. Your phone knows where you work and where you live and who is texting you. It&rsquo;s a gold mine for everyone from phone thieves to advertisers to hackers.</p>
<p>Many smartphone owners would be surprised at how easy it is to learn some basic hacks which allow you to extract data from someone else&rsquo;s smartphone. But there are a few simple steps that they can take to make it much harder.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that it&rsquo;s probably impossible to completely hacker-proof your phone. If government spies are trying to break into your phone, they are probably going to get in. But you <em>can</em> stop your run of the mill identity thieves.</p>
<h3>Tip #1: Lock your smartphone!</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s so simple, and yet so effective!&nbsp;Why should someone bother hacking into your phone when they can just pick it up and see everything on it? You need a lockscreen with a password or an unlock pattern or a fingerprint scanner.&nbsp;Using a password is the <em>most</em> secure technique, and the more characters you have to enter, the better. But even a simple pin code or unlock pattern is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Most Android phones support unlock patterns. If you use one, though, you should take one extra step for security: wipe down your phone?s screen frequently! This way a thief can&rsquo;t simply follow the smudged fingerprints on the screen to determine your unlock pattern.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another lock screen tip for those of you with iPhones:&nbsp;by default, iPhones allow you to do a few things without unlocking your phone, like voice dialing and previewing texts. You can disable this, though, and you should.&nbsp;Unless you like the idea of a stranger at the coffee shop reading your texts!</p>
<h3>Tip #3: Don&rsquo;t connect to open Wi-Fi networks!</h3>
<p>Avoid that free coffee shop Wi-Fi if it doesn&rsquo;t have a password!&nbsp;Any device, whether it?s a phone or a tablet or a laptop, which is connected to an open Wi-Fi is a hacker?s dream. With some basic software installed, a hacker can see almost everything anyone on the Wi-Fi network is doing &ndash; sending emails, logging into Facebook, etc.</p>
<p>The good news is, people are wising up to the fact that having unsecured Wi-Fi is not a good idea. Some places still offer it, though. If you don?t have to ask for a password to get in, it?s probably not a good idea to use that Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>Speaking of Wi-Fi: if you got your iPhone from AT&amp;T it has an interesting extra feature.&nbsp;Any time an AT&amp;T iPhone detects a Wi-Fi network called <em>attwifi</em>, it will automatically try to connect to it.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s a problem, to put it bluntly. A hacker could just setup a network, call it <em>attwifi</em>, and wait for people?s phones to automatically connect to it so they can extract information. The good news is, this is a feature you can turn off on your iPhone, and you should. Just open the Settings app, tap Wi-Fi, and tap the check box next to ?Ask to join networks?. And contact AT&amp;T customer support and tell them that you don&rsquo;t approve of them making their customers&rsquo; phones vulnerable in this way.</p>
<h3>Tip #4: Turn off location tagging on your smartphone&rsquo;s camera</h3>
<p>When&nbsp;you&nbsp;take a picture with your smartphone, it adds the GPS coordinates of the place where you&nbsp;took the picture to the image file. Later on, that can help you&nbsp;remember where you&nbsp;took the picture at.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s convenient, but many times when you upload that picture to a website or email it to a friend, the GPS coordinates remain embedded in the file. Anyone who has that picture can figure out where you took it. And if it&rsquo;s your house, well, now they know where you live.&nbsp;And that?s no good.</p>
<p>You can turn this feature off on Android phones, although the details depend on what phone you have. You should be able to find instructions with a Google search.&nbsp;On an iPhone, go&nbsp;to Settings, and then privacy, and then Location services and then you should see an option for the camera. Switch that to off.</p>
<h3>Tip #5: Require a password for purchases</h3>
<p>This&nbsp;is something we&rsquo;ve talked about before, but it?s worth repeating: both Android and iPhone allow you to set a password on the phone that must be entered before you can make purchases on the phone. Stopping kids or others from running up charges on your phone is always a great idea.</p>
<h3>Tip #6: Disable third party cookies</h3>
<p>Everybody likes cookies, right?&nbsp;Well, maybe not if they are cookies on your computer which can allow advertisers to track what websites you visit.&nbsp;For those readers&nbsp;who don?t know, a cookie is a small text file that a website places on your computer or smartphone. They can be used to help websites remember to automatically log you in, which is great. But they can also help advertisers to track you which not everybody likes.</p>
<p>On the iPhone&rsquo;s Safari browser you can stop this. Safari lets you&nbsp;disable &lsquo;third party cookies&rsquo;, which are the kind of cookies that many&nbsp;people don&rsquo;t want, the kind that help advertisers offer targeted ads.&nbsp;Most browsers now offer a &lsquo;DO NOT TRACK&rsquo; option as well. It&rsquo;s a good idea to turn this on. Now here?s the thing, the &lsquo;do not track&rsquo; option is not universally respected. There are some advertisers that will ignore it and track you anyway. But it can?t hurt to have it turned on.</p>
<h3>Tip #7: Wipe your personal data before you return your phone to the store</h3>
<p>Occasionally you may need to take your smartphone somewhere to get it repaired or to swap it for a working model. Before you do this, it&rsquo;s a really good idea to wipe all of your personal data from your phone! What you need to do is reset your phone to factory defaults. Your smartphone should come with instructions on how to do this.&nbsp;Of course you should backup all your personal data before you do this as it WILL be erased!</p>
<p>So these are just a few tips that will help you keep the personal data on your smartphone more secure from thieves, from hackers and even from advertisers. And if nothing else, you should always,&nbsp;<em>always &ndash;</em></p>
<p><strong>LOCK YOUR PHONE.</strong></p></body></html>

<strong>Q: I just got an iPad Mini. I already have a computer connected to the internet at home, and I'm wondering what equipment I need to set up Wi-Fi to use with the iPad. I have never had wireless in my house.<span id="more-8813">

<strong>A: Setting up a wireless network for your home is a fairly easy process, Glen. To get started, you'll need to purchase a device called a wireless router from your local electronics store or online. Before you do, though, there are a few things you need to know.


[caption id="attachment_8814" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="/media/2014/05/wireless_router.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-8814" src="/media/2014/05/wireless_router-300x201.jpg" alt="The wireless router: your pathway to the land of Wi-Fi.

First of all, you'll want to make sure that the router you buy will support the right Wi-Fi standards for your needs. The most common ones you'll see these days are G, N and AC, with the speed of the connection increasing in that order. A lot of wireless devices (including your new iPad) will work with G, but we recommend going with an N router (this will be listed on the package). All routers support older standards, so don't worry that getting a new one will stop your older devices from connecting with it.

At your house, you're most likely connected to the internet through a cable or phone line coming out of the wall (depending on whether you have cable internet or DSL). That line plugs into a device commonly known as a modem, which decodes the signal into something computers can understand. Another line coming from your modem is currently plugged into your computer's network card (this will be an Ethernet cable, which sort of looks like a phone cord only bigger).

When you get your router, you'll need to unplug that Ethernet cable from your computer, and plug it into the router instead. Then you'll connect your computer to the router with another Ethernet cable. Now all of the internet traffic going to your computer and iPad will be routed through the router (which is why they call it... well, you get the idea).

Most router manufacturers include an easy-to-follow "quick setup" manual that will guide you through setting it up. These steps will be different from router to router, but here are a few general things to keep in mind:


<ul>

	
<li>Place your router somewhere relatively high up and free from obstruction. This will help to ensure that your Wi-Fi signal reaches as far as possible without interference. You should especially avoid placing it near large metal objects.









<ul>

	
<li>Make sure you turn on wireless security on the router (you should be given the option during installation). This will require anyone wanting to use your wireless network to enter a password. You'll see a few different security protocols to choose from in the setup, including WPA, WPA2 and WEP. We recommend using WPA or WPA2, because WEP is the weakest of the three. Make sure you come up with a strong password that can't be easily guessed by your neighbors. An unsecured network will allow them to use up your bandwidth, or worse, hack into your computers.









<ul>

	
<li>Your router will also have a host of other settings that you can change through its control panel, which you can access by entering a special address into your web browser. This is often something like "routerlogin.com" or a string of numbers like "192.168.0.1" - the specific address for your router, as well as the login information for that control panel, will be listed in the user manual.









<ul>

	
<li>You'll have the option to give your new wireless network a name while you're setting up. Some people go with the default one that comes with the router, but feel free to name it whatever you want. We suggest "Deemable Tech Is Da Bomb," but that's just us.








Once you've got everything ready, Glen, get out your new iPad. Open Settings, tap "Wi-Fi", and you should see your new Wi-Fi network in the list of available ones. Select it, enter your password and connect. If you can reach the internet from your iPad, congratulations! You just set up a home Wi-Fi network!

<html><body><p>Is it safe to use Wi-Fi in a hotel lobby, or would you be better off to pay for the wired internet in your room? Hosts of Deemable Tech, Ray Hollister and Tom Braun, have the answer. Take a listen to this week&rsquo;s Ask Deemable Tech.</p>
<p><script id="prx-p90798-embed" src="http://www.prx.org/p/90798/embed.js?size=full"></script></p>
<p>RAY: Hi, I&rsquo;m Ray Hollister,</p>
<p>TOM:I&rsquo;m Tom Braun,</p>
<p>RAY: and we&rsquo;re the hosts of Deemable Tech. On the show, we answer your questions about computers, tablets, mobile phones and the Internet, like this question:</p>
<p>Gregory writes, How much more secure is a wired Internet connection vs a wireless connection?</p>
<p>TOM: OK, so there are basically two ways to get your computer online, which as Gregory has pointed out are &lsquo;wired&rsquo; and &lsquo;wireless&rsquo;. &lsquo; Wireles&rsquo;s of course means your computer is not physically plugged into anything. &lsquo;Wired&rsquo; means you literally have one of those CAT5 cables that looks like a thick blue phone line plugged into your computer.</p>
<p>Now, realize there are several different types of connections that we call &lsquo;wireless&rsquo;. You have good old-fashioned wi-fi, which is the type your router at home broadcasts. But you could also be talking about 3g or 4g connections through your cellular service.</p>
<p>RAY: Okay, but out of all these which would you say would be the MOST secure?</p>
<p>TOM: Well, that would definitely be a wired connection. There&rsquo;s no way for someone to intercept the signal without physically cutting the cable and splicing in. But honestly you can never assume that you&rsquo;re absolutely secure. Just because someone isn&rsquo;t intercepting your signal doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t have other means of compromising your security.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to make our listeners paranoid here, but I don&rsquo;t want anyone to assume that simply because you&rsquo;re plugged directly into a hardline that you cannot be hacked.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re on a wireless connection it is definitely easier for someone nearby to intercept your signal.</p>
<p>RAY: So what about someone on a 3g or 4g connection, how secure are they?</p>
<p>TOM: I&rsquo;m gonna go out on a limb and say that a cellular connection is pretty secure. It&rsquo;s going to be at least as secure as an ordinary cellphone call. Now we all know there are ways of hacking those, but if a white van is following you around with advanced cellular signal-breaking equipment, you&rsquo;ve got bigger problems. Or you&rsquo;re on an episode of &lsquo;Person of Interest&rsquo;.</p>
<p>RAY: For ordinary wifi you have secured and unsecured connections. A secured wifi connection is one where you have to enter a password to login. There are several flavors but the only one you need to remember is WPA-2. If your router doesn&rsquo;t have that, use WPA. So, make sure when you&rsquo;re setting up your home router that you do turn on WPA-2 and set a password, or if you if you already have your wifi setup, go into your router settings and add a WPA-2 password.</p>
<p>TOM: You also have open wifi connections. Now let me be very clear: an open wi-fi connection is absolutely unsecure. There are readily available programs that allow people to steal your login and password to Facebook, Gmail and other sites if you access them over an open wifi connection.</p>
<p>So I would be real leery of open wi-fi especially if you are doing business stuff. Make sure if you are in a coffee shop using their wifi that it requires a password to connect. Otherwise you are leaving yourself wide open.</p>
<p>Now, even secured wireless networks can be broken. So if you are doing something that requires a high degree of security, I would stay off public wifi in general.</p>
<p>RAY: So, in summary, wired is the most secure, than cellular, then secured wifi, and unsecured wifi is the worst. But, you&rsquo;re never really totally secure regardless of what type of connection you use.</p>
<p>TOM: Exactly! And that&rsquo;s your daily dose of paranoia, brought to you by Deemable Tech.</p>
