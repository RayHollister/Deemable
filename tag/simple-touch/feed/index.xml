<html><body><p>If you still haven&rsquo;t purchased your <strong>special someone</strong> a present for Valentine&rsquo;s Day, your <strong>sweet-heart</strong> is a gadget junkie, and there&rsquo;s an electronics store on the way home, this article might help you from spending the night snuggled up with Fido. Here&rsquo;s a list of eleven tech gifts under $100 (and one at $129) that will make great last-minute Valentine&rsquo;s Day presents.</p>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>iPod shuffle &ndash; $49</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iPodShuffleAllColors.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-4921 alignleft" title="I see your true colors, and that's why I love you..." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iPodShuffleAllColors-150x150.jpg"  alt="All of the colors of the iPod shuffle" width="135" height="135"></a>The iPod shuffle is a great gift for folks who work out a lot, take the dog for long walks, or who lose things easily. At only $49, it is the cheapest device from Apple that you can buy for your <strong>sweetie pie</strong>, but the sacrifice is that she&rsquo;ll only be able to put about 350 songs on the 2GB of internal storage. Just make sure that she didn&rsquo;t mean to say &ldquo;<a title="Apple - iPod touch - Now in white. It has fun written all over it." href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/" target="_blank">iPod touch</a>&rdquo; (the iPod shuffle&rsquo;s more expensive, touch-screen cousin) when she said she wanted an iPod, or the iPod shuffle might be the <em>only</em> thing you get to touch on Valentine&rsquo;s.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Jawbone Up &ndash; $99.99</h3>
<h3><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/JawboneUp-e1328748635428.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="wp-image-4901 alignleft" title='Jawbone Up - The tech gadget that says "Get up, (get on up) Get up, (get on up) Stay on the scene, (get on up), like a..."' src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/JawboneUp-300x150.jpg"  alt="Jawbone Up" width="180" height="90"></a></h3>
<p>Available in black, white, red, blue and silver, the Jawbone up is more than just another rubbery bracelet that looks like it stole its design from Lance Armstrong&rsquo;s <a title="LIVESTRONG.COM - Lose Weight &amp; Get Fit with Diet, Nutrition &amp; Fitness Tools" href="http://www.livestrong.com/" target="_blank">LIVESTRONG</a> campaign. The Jawbone Up has a motion sensor inside that monitors your <strong>dearest one&rsquo;s</strong> activity during the day and sleep at night. Then, it syncs with and displays all that information on an app on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. During the day, the Jawbone Up will keep track of how many steps your <strong>stud muffin</strong> takes, calculate how many calories he burned, and he can set it to remind him to get up and get moving when he&rsquo;s been staring at the computer screen for too long. At night, it keeps track of how long it took him to fall asleep, how many hours he slept, and how much of it was light or deep sleep. In the morning, the Jawbone Up will silently wake your <strong>Prince Charming</strong> with the Smart Alarm. The Smart Alarm wakes him up at the ideal point in his sleep cycle just before his desired wake up time by gently vibrating on his wrist. You&rsquo;re <strong>sugar pie</strong> will wake up feeling like a million bucks, and you&rsquo;ll get to sleep in!</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>iPod nano &ndash; $129</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iPodNanoWatch.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-4925" title="Her girlfriends will ask her, 'Is that an iPod nano on your wrist or does your man just love you more than mine loves me?'" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iPodNanoWatch-e1328757231886-150x150.jpg"  alt="iPod Nano with a red watch band and Minnie Mouse watch face." width="150" height="150"></a>For an extra eighty dollars over the price of the iPod shuffle, the iPod nano offers a lot more bang for your buck. Starting at 8 GB, it can hold around 1,400 songs, and it has a multi-touch, color screen. Additionally, it has a built-in accelerometer and it works with Nike + iPod compatible cardio machines to keep track of all of your <strong>buttercup&rsquo;s</strong> workouts. It also has an FM radio that she can pause, rewind and fast forward live radio, and with one of the many third-party wristbands available it makes a nifty watch with 18 different watch faces.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Apple TV &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/TVappleTVandRemote.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4934" title="Apple TV" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/appletv.jpg"  alt="" width="130" height="130"></a>With an Apple TV, your <strong>cuddly-wuddly</strong> can watch or listen to anything in his iTunes account, stream Netflix, Vimeo, and YouTube videos and watch live sports from the NBA, NFL and NHL. With the airplay feature, he can stream anything from his iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to the big screen of his home television. Another benefit is its simple and easy set up; your guy can start enjoying the Apple TV right away when he invites you over tonight for a movie and snuggle session.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Roku 2 XS &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Roku2_XS_Remote.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4959" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Roku2_XS_Remote-300x225.jpg"  alt="Roku2 XS with Remote" width="162" height="122"></a>If your <strong>snuggle-bear</strong> isn&rsquo;t an Apple fanboy, but he would still like to watch video from the Internet on his big screen TV, another great option is the Roku 2 XS, which offers some of the same features, including the NBA, NHL, and Netflix, but also includes more features like Amazon Instant Video, Pandora, Hulu Plus and even Angry Birds; however, it doesn&rsquo;t support Air Play or iTunes. Another benefit of the Roku 2 XS over the Apple TV is that it is backwards compatible with older televisions. So, even if your <strong>hunk</strong> doesn&rsquo;t have a high-definition TV, he can still invite you over to watch <a title="Netflix - The English Patient" href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=477351&amp;trkid=4451748&amp;t=The+English+Patient" target="_blank">The English Patient</a> on Netflix.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>iPhone 4 &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iphone4-black.png" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4945" title="It doesn't have Siri, but it's not too shabby." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/iphone4-black.png"  alt="iPhone 4" width="150" height="150"></a>The Apple iPhone 4 is great for the girlfriend who is disorganized and perpetually running late for the special dates you plan. It may not be an iPhone 4S, but at $99 the iPhone 4 won&rsquo;t break the bank either. With easy scheduling and reminders, great games, and FaceTime for late-night romantic chats with your <strong>darling</strong>, the iPhone 4 is an excellent all-in-one gadget for last-minute gift-givers. If your honey is an Android fan, there is also a plethora of <a title="Android Central | Phones Category | Sorted by Price" href="https://wl-androidcentral.bbymsolutions.com/category/phones?navCode=4tDTVKmeZ9&amp;sort=lowPrice&amp;page=1" target="_blank">Android smart phones available for $99 or less</a>.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Kindle &ndash; $79 &amp; Kindle Touch &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Kindle-Touch-store-e1328762980318.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-4948" title="Toucha toucha toucha touch me, I wanna be..." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Kindle-Touch-store-e1328762980318-150x150.jpg"  alt="Kindle Touch" width="150" height="150"></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/kindlejeans.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4995" style="margin: 10px;" title="Kindle e-Reader - Don't take it the wrong way, but it wants to get into your jeans." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/kindlejeans-e1329190497112-150x150.jpg"  alt="Kindle e-Reader" width="120" height="120"></a>If your <strong>beloved</strong> is a bookworm, the Kindle (on the right) or Kindle touch (on the left) are both excellent choices. The Kindle Touch is light, fast, and small with a touchscreen and audio features, although books can only be downloaded when wi-fi connected, and at this price it is ad-supported. The regular Kindle is lighter and skinnier than its Touch counterpart and has the same size screen, but getting around the menus requires using a directional pad, and it doesn&rsquo;t play music or audio books. If she loves to read but complains that she can&rsquo;t find the time, she may not even know how much she would enjoy this device. It is very convenient to find new books in the Kindle bookstore, and she may find the time to read once she has a device that fits easily in her purse or her back pocket.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Nook Simple Touch &ndash; $99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BarnesNobleNook.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4954" title="More touchy-feely stuff" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BarnesNobleNook-250x300.jpg"  alt="Barnes &amp; Noble Nook" width="120" height="144"></a>Another e-reader that makes a great last-minute gift for your <strong>sweetiekins</strong> is the Nook Simple Touch. The Nook boasts that it is 25% faster than any other reader, and it does not have any ads; however, it does not have a web browser, and, like the regular Kindle, it does not play music or audio books.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750 &ndash; $59.99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Logitech_K750.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4956" title="Sunshine on my keyboard keeps it charged up..." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Logitech_K750-300x165.jpg"  alt="Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard K750" width="168" height="92"></a>If your <strong>heartthrob</strong>&nbsp;is always busy blogging, the Logitech solar keyboard is the perfect choice. It&rsquo;s green technology requires no batteries, no wires, and offers easy setup. This is a gadget that will make your man&rsquo;s life easier and his desk more streamlined. It runs on&nbsp;Windows&reg; XP, Windows Vista&reg;, Windows&reg; 7 and Mac OS&reg; X 10.4. It reportedly works on most flavors of Linux too, but it&rsquo;s not specifically supported.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>Powermat &ndash; $79.99</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/power-mat.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4962" title="It's not a hoverboard, but it's still pretty awesome." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/power-mat-300x156.jpg"  alt="Powermat" width="210" height="109"></a></p>
<p>For the <strong>hunk</strong> who already has all the gadgets that he wants, the perfect Valentine&rsquo;s gift is a wireless charging mat called the Powermat. As a former Palm Pre owner, I miss being able to just set my phone down on the Touchstone and charge it without having to plug it in. With the Powermat and a matching&nbsp;receiver door, almost any device can work just like my Pre did. The Powermat simplifies the charging process and cuts down visual cord clutter for a guy who juggles several electronic devices. Plus, it&rsquo;s just really cool.</p>
</div>
<div style="min-height: 100%; min-width: 100%; float: left;">
<h3>OtterBox &ndash; $19.95 &ndash; 49.955</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Otterbox.jpg" class="gallery_colorbox"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4961" title="Don't go breaking my phone. I won't go breaking your phone..." src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Otterbox-172x300.jpg"  alt="The OtterBox for iPhone" width="103" height="180"></a>For the clumsy girlfriend, some sort of protection for her gadgets is in order. One of the best of device-protecting accessories is the OtterBox. These range in price (Defender Series $49.95, Reflex Series $34.95, Commuter Series $34.95, Impact Series $19.95), but are well worth the extra dollar spent when her device accidentally goes flying off the couch and hits the floor during an intense snuggling session with your <strong>mamacita</strong>.</p>
