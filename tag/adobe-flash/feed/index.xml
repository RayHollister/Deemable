<h3>New Horizons flies by Pluto</h3>
<p>Space has been in the news this week. The spacecraft New Horizons, which launched in 2006, ventured closer to the dwarf planet Pluto than any other man-made object has ever been, 7,800 miles from the surface of Pluto. And the best part is, it took pictures! New Horizons has already sent back a handful of high resolution images of Pluto and its moons and more are expected to follow. New Horizons? journey is not over yet, as it is scheduled to continue on out into the largely unexplored Kuiper Belt.</p>
<h3>#PrimeDayFail</h3>
<p>Amazon held their much-hyped Prime Day event this week to celebrate their 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>Described as a summertime Black Friday for customers with Amazon Prime accounts, the company promised great deals on hot items all throughout the day on Wednesday. And depending on who you are and what you were looking to buy, this was true.</p>
<p>It was certainly a success for Amazon, who reported that sales were up 80 percent on Prime Day. They also most likely saw a jump in Amazon Prime subscriptions, since you had to be a member to get the deals.</p>
<p>The overwhelming reaction on social media, though, was ?meh.? Disgruntled shoppers quickly took to Twitter and Facebook with the hashtag #primedayfail to voice their complaints about what they saw as Amazon?s failure to deliver on all of their hype. Reactions ranged from disappoint with the selection of sale items (some described it as being like a bad garage sale full of weird stuff), underwhelming prices, and frustration over limited quantities for items they actually wanted.</p>

<h3><b>Nintendo President &amp; CEO Saturo Iwata</b></h3>
<p>Nintendo president Satoru Iwata passed Saturday July 11th at the age of 55 after an almost year-long struggle with cancer.</p>
<p>For those of you who aren&rsquo;t familiar with Iwata-san, early in his career he helped develop or worked on the Mario, Legend of Zelda, Pok&eacute;mon, Super Smash Bros., Animal Crossing and Kirby series.</p>
<p>Iwata was promoted to president of Nintendo in 2003 and became CEO of Nintendo of America in 2013. Iwata took over Nintendo when it was struggling from poor sales of the GameCube, and brought the highly successful Wii and Nintendo DS to market. He was uniquely the first Nintendo president that was not related to the Yamauchi family since its founding.</p>
<p>Iwata was a very charismatic business leader that reached out to the community. He started an interview series on the Nintendo website called &ldquo;<a href="http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/">Iwata Asks</a>&rdquo; where he discussed games with the developers and gave gamers a behind-the-scene view of the process.</p>
<p>He famously said at the Game Developers Conference in 2005, &ldquo;On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There have been tons of memorials to Iwata on the Internet since his passing, one of my favorites was Mashable&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://mashable.com/2015/07/13/games-iwata-memorial/">5 games you can play to honor late Nintendo President Satoru Iwata</a>&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Hacking Team Gets Hacked</h3>
<p>Secretive cybersecurity firm Hacking Team has long courted controversy for selling advanced cyber surveillance tools to governments with a less-than-spotless record on human rights. Well, two weeks ago they were&nbsp;hacked. Massively. An unknown hacker going by the pseudonym of Phineas Fisher <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/07/09/how-spyware-peddler-hacking-team-was-publicly-dismantled/">broke into the company?s systems and dumped over 400 GB of the company?s data</a>, including invoices, code for software, and software exploits it had paid for known as ?zero day exploits?, and posted it using the company?s own Twitter feed. Most controversially, the documents show that Hacking Team was doing business with Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Russia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and the UAE, many of whom have been criticized by international human rights organizations for their aggressive surveillance of citizens, activists and journalists both domestically and overseas. Even Sudan, with whom Hacking Team had denied connections, was shown to be a recent client. These countries didn?t just use Hacking Team?s software, they often called upon Hacking Team?s specialized services to go after specific ?high value targets?, including journalists.</p>
<p>At this time Hacking Team has officially requested that its clients <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/hacking-team-asks-customers-to-stop-using-its-software-after-hack">immediately cease use of all of its tools and software</a>. This is slightly odd as leaked documents show that the company claims to have the ability to shut its own software down remotely.</p>
<p>The Hacking Team dump has also had some consequences for the larger software industry. The company had purchased a number of what are called ?zero-day exploits?, which are unpatched, undiscovered software vulnerabilities that can be used by hackers to infiltrate software or systems. Three major zero-day exploits were discovered for Flash, which Adobe had not known about and has been scrambling to patch. The fact that this company had access to loopholes in such a major, widespread piece of software is reason for concern.</p>
<p>Also, it is just one more reason that everyone should stop using Flash.</p>
<h3>Firefox Axes Flash</h3>
<p>Speaking of Flash. Computerworld is reporting that partly as a result of these new and really bad vulnerabilities, <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2948012/security/adobe-flash-must-die-firefox-facebook-itbwcw.html">Mozilla Firefox has taken the unusual step of blocking Flash</a> until it is completely patched. Alex Stamos, the chief of security for Facebook, has called on Adobe to announce an end-of-life date for Flash.</p>

<p>You have really been paying attention, Felicia! Earlier this year there was a big scare when researchers discovered that there were three big security holes in Flash. These vulnerabilities would have allowed hackers to do very bad things if you visited the wrong websites.</p>
<p>Adobe, the company that makes Flash, has since patched all three of those security holes, but we feel that it&rsquo;s really hard to trust that there aren&rsquo;t more issues that we don?t know about. Plus, Flash is an outdated technology that most people don?t need. So we say it&rsquo;s time to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Flash is installed on most browsers on desktops and laptops, so you most likely do have it. To find out for sure if you have it follow the &ldquo;Check my Flash&rdquo; link below. If the page asks you to install Flash, you don&rsquo;t have it installed on the browser you are using. Otherwise, you do.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer" target="_blank">Check My Flash</a></strong></p>
<p>Flash is everywhere because it used to be the piece of technology that allowed websites to show fun animations and play videos. Now, though, there&rsquo;s an advanced technology called HTML5 that lets you do that kind of stuff much more safely and without being constantly bugged to download updates. Flash is also slow and clunky to use. iPhones have never supported it because of this, which is one of the reasons that the rest of the internet has gradually moved away from it.</p>
<p>So, basically, it&rsquo;s not that great, it&rsquo;s kind of clunky, it&rsquo;s not 100 percent safe, and you don&rsquo;t need it. Like we said, it&rsquo;s time to get rid of it!</p>
<p>Uninstalling it is easy to do. Just follow the steps on Adobe&rsquo;s site for removing Flash from <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-windows.html" target="_blank"><strong>Windows </strong></a>and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/uninstall-flash-player-mac-os.html" target="_blank"><strong>Mac OS</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Now, we should note that some people might actually need Flash on their computers. For instance, some corporate intranet sites require it, which means uninstalling it entirely is not a good option if you have to use one of those sites. However, even if you have to keep Flash around, there are ways to make it safer for you to use.</p>
<p>One very easy way is to use Google&rsquo;s Chrome browser. Chrome runs Flash inside what is called a &ldquo;sandbox,&rdquo; which means it is isolated from the rest of the computer.</p>
<p>If that isn&rsquo;t safe enough for you, there is a free browser plugin for both Firefox and Chrome called FlashBlock. FlashBlock, as the name implies, blocks all Flash on a web page by default, leaving only a small icon. You have to right-click that icon and tell it you want to enable that piece of Flash in order to view it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure if you need Flash or not, try uninstalling it and see if you can get along without it! After all, you can reinstall it any time you want. In the meantime, you&rsquo;ll probably see a lot fewer of those auto-playing ad videos when you visit websites. We bet you won&rsquo;t miss those at all!</p>
