		<description><![CDATA[I have been taken for a ride!  I read Eva&#039;s story but my ending is different.  I bought into the story and spent the 350 to boot.  Now because of their return to me (and I believed them) I am sitting with two gift cards totaling $200 that was to purchase a piece of equipment so I wouldn&#039;t be hacked again.  :They&quot; didn&#039;t follow through so I am out of luck and don&#039;t know where I stand in security.  What should I do now.  I have a &quot;case number, a copy of what looks like a support report, and two cards I can&#039;t use - for iTunes.  What can I do now?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This feels like vindication to me. My wife got me a smart phone and I hate every second of it.  It frequently takes three to five attempts to make it register each command, making texting, gaming, even answering the phone a nightmare. She just thinks I&#039;m clumsy and/or don&#039;t understand technology, despite me assembling her computer from scratch, building a few RPGs and shooters as a hobby, and am a jeweler as a profession. I think I know how to aim my finger. To make matters worse, I&#039;m on a family plan and can&#039;t exchange or replace my phone for about 6 months, since I have to go back to where my parents live and have them present, in the store, at the time. yay. I&#039;m not exited about having to use special gloves or a little wand just to answer the phone. I guess they only thought various hipsters and millennials would use smartphones, not hard working folks with calluses.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure that I agree with all your solutions to fix CL, but for the personals section at least, it seems the problem is exactly the opposite: not enough stuff is being flagged and deleted and it&#039;s &#062;80% spam and fake ads looking to harvest phone numbers and Kik or Snapchat names since CL neutered their doing so with e-mail addys via their relay system. (Part of that problem is a lack of critical thinking skills both for folks browsing and potentially replying to ads and in posting them. One aspect of that is the internet itself and Google that makes everything seemingly local, that you can look up events and streets and virtually wander around cities thousands of miles away.) 

It&#039;s still heading for Irrelevant Land though for that reason, too.


PS: 30 employees seems like an overestimate, but I won&#039;t formally question your assertion. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adding to what has already been discussed above. I have the thought that if somebody is looking up your profile but isn&#039;t communicating with you, Facebook tries to communicate this to you by asking if you know this person.. Can anybody confirm or disprove this??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this article. I am sending people here that don&#039;t believe me when I say I cannot operate a phone. I have never been able to operate a touchscreen. They very seldom respond to my touch, and when they do, they go crazy. I have never owned a smartphone and never will as I cannot use them. A stylus is a fair work around, but is difficult to use for me. I only use the stylus as my job bought me an iPhone 6 and insisted that I have to use it, so a stylus-ing I go! Everything these days is going to touchscreens, and it&#039;s a little frightening as I will be left out due to a physical issue that I cannot correct. In ten years, I am going to have to buy those pens on chains and swap them out for styluses, then mount them all over my house, and in my car too........ sucks!]]></description>
